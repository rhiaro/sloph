The server handles this update activity however it wants, but the obvious thing to do is take the `object` of the activity and make the indicated changes.\r\n\r\nSo far it:\r\n\r\n* Doesn't have proper authentication, just a field to enter in a key that the server uses to verify me.\r\n* Doesn't do endpoint discovery, so I have to type that in as well.\r\n* Only understands how to display ActivityStreams2 Collections, and only knows how to edit items within the Collections.\r\n* Specifically only knows how to add `name`, `published` and `tags` to items in a Collection.\r\n\r\nWill be expanding its object editing abilities soon.\r\n\r\n[Code on github](https://github.com/rhiaro/morph).
