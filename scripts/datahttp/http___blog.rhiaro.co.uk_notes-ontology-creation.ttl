  sioc:content """Yesterday I unexpectedly read two whole papers about ontology development
methodologies.  They were open in tabs I don't remember opening, but
presumably did so during our weekly [Ontologies With A
View](http://ontologieswithaview.blogspot.com/) meeting last Friday.  There
are still a bunch more tabs open with papers or articles about the same thing,
so maybe I'll read those later..  
  
The notes are here more or less as I scribbled them down whilst reading, and I
haven't expanded with any analysis or discussion as of yet.  
  
Notes in purple are things I intend/need to investigate further; colour-coding
is just for me, really.  
  
  
**Jean Vincent Fonou-Dombeu & Magda Husiman (2011)  _Combining Ontology Development Methodologies _****and Semantic Web Platforms for E-government ****_Domain Ontology Development_.  International Journal of Web & Semantic Technology (IJWesT) Vol.2, No.2, April 2011 **  
  

  * Start by describing ontology in a human-readable way, then turn to RDF (etc) to be machine readable.
  * Says there's not sufficient practical research around existing technologies or ontology development guidelines that would allow non-experts in e-government domain to make ontologies.  

  * Uses framework from Uschold & King (see later in this post) to describe ontology - technique used here should be platform independent.
  * Then uses UML to semi-formally represent ontology
  * Uses Protege and Jena to convert to OWL and RDF

  * Paper's goal is to produce guidelines for e-government developers to create semantic content AND strengthen adoption of Semantic Web technologies in governments (particularly developing countries).  

  * Outlines RDF, OWL, Protege and Jena (described as leading platforms; mentions other platforms: WebODE, OntoEdit, KAON1, Sesame).  

  * Very critical of other literature; either ontologies have been produced but no practical information given; they've been developed with proprietary platforms; or they're only conceptual and don't say how they could actually be constructed with existing technologies.  other studies have not focused on a methodological approach, which means nothing is easily repeatable.  

  * Detailed comparative studies of methodologies in:
    *     * M. Fernandez-Lopez, “Overview of Methodologies for Building Ontologies, ” In Proceedings of the IJCAI-99 workshop on Ontologies and Problem-Solving Methods (KRR5), Stockholm, Sweden, 2 August, 1999. 
    * H. Beck and H.S Pinto, “Overview of Approach, Methodologies, Standards, and Tools for Ontologies,” Agricultural Ontology Service (UNFAO), 2003. 
    * C. Calero, F. Ruiz and M. Piattini, “Ontologies for Software Engineering and Software Technology, ” Calero.Ruiz.Piattini (Eds.), Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2006.  

  * **Case study: **Ontology for monitoring development projects in developing countries (OntoDPM)
    1. Create with Protege:  

      * class heirarchies
      * slots
      * domain and range of slots
      * Based on the UML
      * Saved as OWL
    2. Then put content in RDF with Jena

  * _Steps:_
    1. identify purpose
    2. build ontology  

      * capture
      * coding
      * integrating existing ontologies
    3. evaluation
    4. documentation
  * _Purpose_
    * Many ontologies are intended for reuse
    * Should survey purposes to clarify options for future projects
  * _Building_
    * Capture
      * Identify key concepts and relationships in domain of interest
      * Produce unambiguous text definitions for these
      * Identify terms for these
      * Agree on all of the above
    * Coding
      * Explicit representation of conceptualisation in a formal language (choose a language)
    * When can capture and coding stages be merged?
    * Differences between building ontology and creating a general knowledge base (thinking about methodology will help with this)
    * Integrating (during either or both of above)
      * Work must be done in agreement between communities
      * Make explicit all assumptions underlying an ontology
  * _Evaluation_
    * Judge against requirements specification (and/or)
    * Judge against competency questions (and/or)
    * Judge against real life
    * This paper looks at knowledge base systems, and adapts for ontologies.
  * _Documentation_
    * Desirable to have established guidelines for documenting
    * Main barrier to effective knowledge sharing is inadequate documentation
    * ALL important assumptions should be documented

  * _Case Study_
    * Main emphasis is on capture phase
    * Initially:
      * define ontology (Gruber)
      * identify users and usage (initially abstract, then clarify with real life)
      * choose language (Ontolingua was chosen)
      * choose method for capture - BDSM (IBM) supported by others:
        * KADS
        * IDEF5
        * OO Analysis and Design techinques
        * Gruber's principles for ontology design
    * Categorisation is fundamental to the human condition (Lakoff)
      * Not heirarchical, but:
        * GENERAL  
       ^  
   BASIC  ->  primary with respect to knowledge organisation  
       v  
SPECIFIC

        * eg.  
      SUPER:   Animal    /   Furniture  
      BASIC:    Dog        /   Chair  
      SUB:        Retriever /   Rocker
        * Certain concepts used subconsciously, rather than understood intellectually.
          * These have a more important psychological status.
        * Therefore paper uses middle-out approach to capture terms
          * (bottom-up = too much detail unnecessarily,
          * top-down = risks imprecision)
        * BASIC concepts first because:
          * most important
          * used to define non-BASIC terms
          * increase clarity, especially for non-technical use
          * backed by BSDM experience of paper author
  * _Scoping_
    * Brainstorming
    * Consult corpora if there aren't enough domain experts to brainstorm
    * Grouping
      * structure terms into naturally arising sub-groups
      * collate synonyms
      * consider things that might refer to each other
  * _Meta-ontology_
    * Don't commit too early, can restrict thinking.  Let concepts and relationships themselves determine requirements.
    * Be consistent.
    * Use technologically neutral language ('thing' vs 'entity').
    * Start with areas where there's most overlap.
    * Work from basic terms to more abstract ones within an area.
  * _Producing definitions_
    * Agreeing on definitions (varying degrees of problems)
    * Handling ambiguous terms
      * clarify ideas without technical terms
      * use a dictionary!
      * label definitions, eg. x1, x2
      * determine most important concept
      * choose a term, avoiding original ambigious one
    * Avoid new terms
    * Terms get in the way (peoples' preconceived ideas) - concentrate on underlying meaning and concepts.
