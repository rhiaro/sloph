  sioc:content """An idle day.  
  
I sat around the hotel writing a lot.  
  
H returned from her kitesurfing course mid-afternoon and we had a mosey around
town. We regrouped with everyone else for dinner in a nice sea-front
restaurant that was a lot like all of the other nice sea-front restaurants we
had eaten at. Apple moussaka was good.  
  
Then we drove to Sinai. About an hour from Dahab.  
  
And we climbed the mountain.  
  
Our local guide consitently told us to take it easy. We were all already
exhaisted, so the climb was slow and steady and probably took about two hours.
The night was hot and thirsty and our way was was lit only by our torches. The
trail consited mostly of a gentle slope with steeper parts being roughly
stepped. There are a number of huts selling cold drinks at gradually
escalating prices en route.  
  
At the top, our guide reccommended to us his favourite rock and we settled for
a bit. Sitting still in a high place became chilly but we al fell asleep for
an hour or so. Based on what we had learnt was possible in Israel, we decided
that we were napping in the EXACT spot that Moses recieved the Ten
Commandments.  
  
The sunrise took ages, and by this time a massive group of Australian and
Italian pilgrims had arrived at the top, singing and praying obnoxiously (in
my opinion) and somewhat disrupting the notion of a nice peaceful sunrise..
Many also seemed to be intrigued by the fact we were camped out on a ledge
below the peak, to the extent that they started taking photos.  
  
Once the sun was firmly above the horizon our guide summoned us and we opted
for the 3000 steps route to the bottom. This meant no other annoying tourists,
and plenty of shade. Not to mention some awesome views of heaps of rocks.  
  
We got back to the truck around 7am where Dave and Nev had French toast and
beans waiting for us. Then, we drove. And almost exclusively slept.  
  
We stopped for lunch at Pizza Hut (vastly superiour food and prices compared
to the UK) as next to nothing was open because of Ramadan.  
  
We camped in the desert that night. I opted to sleep outside again although it
was particularly windy. Heather and Kathryn made a concoction with soya mince
and vegetables and pasta. Worse things have happened.  
  
The night was disrupted firstly when a potentially crazy Bedouin chap appeared
and shook all of our hands enthusiastically and, we think, tried to invite us
to sleep in his hut. We politely declined.  
  
Much later I was woken by Lizzie dragging all of her belongings back into the
truck. It emerged that the Bedouin man and his friend had decided that outside
the girls' tents would be a great place for a lengthy chat. After some
persuasion by Dave, they ledt eventually. In hindsight this incident was
hilarious.  
  
I woke up with sand ingrained in my skin. Mmm. But so did everyone who had
been in a tent. So I had been no worse off.
