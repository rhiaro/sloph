# Local organiser, BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium

Super excited to bring the BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium to Edinburgh for the biggest and [best](https://twitter.com/handee/status/604700446935117825) one yet! I've been to every Lovelace since 2009 and lightly helped with a few; I've got so much out of this event, it was awesome to be able to really give back. (Handled local sponsors, arranged venue, catering, social event, stored a literal tower of boxes of swag in my office; ramped up recruiting for Edinburgh participants including running a poster making workshop a couple of weeks beforehand).""" ;
