**K. Faith Lawrence & Dr. Monica Schrafel (2007)  _Amateur Fiction Online - The Web of Community Trust: _****_A Case Study in Community Focused Design for the Semantic Web. _****Intelligence, Agents, Multimedia (IAM) Group, ****School of Electronics and Computer Science, ****University of Southampton.**  
**  
**_NB. Need to read her full thesis, of the same name.  Will probably clear up some of the questions I scribbled whilst reading the paper._  
**  
**Finding out if Semantic Web tools can be brought to hobbyist groups on the Web.  

  * Uses the online fiction community; suggests they could benefit from:
    * improved searching
    * improved meta data
    * automatic recommendations
    * trust webs
    * personalisation.
  * A HCI project, so usability tests and comparisons with current systems are key.

_Related work_

  * Community centered design
    * to determine user needs - through continual interactions and user studies.
    * to consider how reader-facing apps present themselves and particular community
      * responsibility of being a portal - need clear affordences and points of failure.
  * Trust and Semantic Communities
    * The semantic web “provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.” -_ Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler, and Ora Lassila. The semantic web. Scientiﬁc American, May 2001._
    * Do we trust:
      * metadata
      * data
      * mechanism by which data is returned
      * person requesting data?
    * Many definitions of trust.
    * Jennifer Golbeck's trust onotology to go with FOAF (_Jennifer Golbeck, Bijan Parsia, and James Hendler. Trust networks on the semantic web. In Proceedings of Cooperative Intelligent Agents 2003, 2003._): ratings of 1 - 9 for trust of associates.  Extended for FicNet (this paper) 
    * Here, trust: "the expectations that arise that an individual will not act in a way that is detrimental to another individual or community."
      * I might need to expand that for my stuff... maybe... maybe this will do.

_Case study_

  * Community predates the Internet. (duh)
  * Necessary to get opinions from people outside of the amateur writing community, because it is broad. Such as parents/guardians of members.
  * Questionnaire
    * General information
    * Reading habits
    * Community involvement
    * Access and distribution of materials
  * Questionnaire distributed by:
    * requests to archives to pass on to members
    * LiveJournal
    * emails to specific interested parties
    * mailing lists / bulletin boards of relevant special interest groups.
  * In two weeks, 1116 responses, from 30 countries.
  * Used to inform ontology design for FicNet, and OntoMedia.

_Fan Online Persona (FOP)_

  * Extension of FOAF, tailored for needs of online readers and writers.
  * foaf:person -> fop:persona
  * Separates environments for on and offline
  * fop:NomDe - context for name
  * Illusion of anonymity is fundamental to fanfic community (who are a large part of online amateur writers)
  * Most authors have one or more pseudonyms.
  * 80% said email address is the most personal information they should be asked for.  ('of the 80%, 15% said _no_ personal information should be requested from anyone - does this make sense? Do they mean _other_ than email address?  but that's the 80... If they're in the 80, they can't be part of that 15...)
  * Privacy is the main thing holding back FOAF (_Joseph Smarr. Technical and privacy challenges for integrating foaf into existing __applications. Presented at 1st Workshop on Friend of a Friend, Social Networking __and the Semantic Web, September 2004._)
  * Personas aren't meaningless, because people become very attached to them, and only create new ones for specific reasons (says who? No citation..)
  * Expands foaf:document and foaf:groups
  * Creation, exchange and review of works is the point of these communities.
  * FOP dismisses FOAF info like work and school as irrelevant or potentially dangerous.
    * [Me]  I think the on/offline divide won't be so extreme for many amateur film makers (another story for _consumers_) because often their faces are in their movies... Also anecdotal evidence from my own experiences that I'm open to having proven to be a minority.  _Actors_ vs _characters_ is an interesting distinction too.  One amateur film maker can have many _personas_, even across one channel of output.
  * Options for FOP determined through long term study of metadata commonly attached to works. (Something I can do, too).

_Trust_

  * FilmTrust by Golbeck (just joined, it was closed last time I looked).
    * Could be prettier... but 2169 members!
    * Visualisations of the network - I need to get good at this.
  * Reader has to trust info from author falls within a certain level of accuracy.  In amateur writing, it is more acceptable to be over cautious than lenient.  Differing standards of acceptable content.
    * Less trust is lost if a story is underrated than overrated (resulting in disappointment)
    * A minority mislabeling work has a big effect on reputation of an archive/community (_HelpingHands community members. A place to pitch in and help - a website __creation resource and project. LiveJournal Community, 2005._)
  * Writer has to trust reader to make the right decision.
  * FicNet has a more specialised trust system than Golbeck's.
    * Largest contention in this field is adult material and younger readers (debated because this contrasts with IRL - no restricted areas in book stores, or suitability rating scheme for books).
    * Initially focussed on age.
    * Personas could vouch for each other.  Creating fake personae to validate another wasn't worth payoff?  Non malicious statements of distrust?
    * How to integrate trust and distrust webs?
_Future_

  * Ontologies developed, ready to be used by applications!
    * Ontologies will be continually refined.
    * Now designing applications.
      * Using info already gathered via quesitonnaire, re: UI, functionality.
  * Integrate with OntoMedia to describe works, and link works with people.
  
=> How did they get to talk to the parents of younger users?  Did they ask the
members to put them in touch?  That doesn't seem like a realistic expectation
to have, to me..
