**  
**I spent most of this week in a remote village by the sea in the Scottish Highlands.  
  
When I came back I read and made notes about the [Semantic Web and social
machines](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/03/phd-notes-about-semantic-web-and-
social.html) by TBL; and typed up some notes from a while ago about
[OntoMedia](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/03/phd-notes-about-annotating-
multimedia.html) and the [Semantic Web and
communities](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/03/phd-notes-on-sw-and-
communities.html) by K. Faith Lawrence.  
  
I also translated all of my written meeting notes into Evernote, which
promptly glitched out and doubled the amount of typing I had to do.  (I
considered switching back to Google Docs, but I _need_ labels).  _I sure love
technology._  
_  
_I refamiliarised myself with the structure OWL.  [Awesome diagrams
here](http://www.infowebml.ws/rdf-owl/graphical-representations.htm#Resource).  
_  
_I did some more thinking about how I need to work with amateur content
creators to make an ontology that fits their workflow.  I should have finished
the planning stage of this ages ago, but.. I blame the ILWhack.  
  
I keep wondering about the best way to have a system of consistent URIs across
a network where the information can move from server to server on the whim of
a user.  During this wonderment I discovered that purl.org's login system is
broken.  I joined the mailing list, and people complain about it and have it
re-fixed fairly regularly, so I'll just wait..
