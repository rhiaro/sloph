  sioc:content """We spent our first day in Dahab chilling out in restaurants by the beach,
splashing about by the Red Sea and recovering from the ferry. Contrary to
first impression, Dahab turned out to be fantastic. Locals are friendly and
welcoming, food is incredibly cheap and the sea is warm and salty.  
  
We're staying at Bishbishi hotel with clean and comfortable grounds and
excessively friendly thoughtful staff. There are cats everywhere. Breakfast is
good. Aircon costs extra and H initially refused to contribute. She changed
her mind after waking up at 4am melted to the bed. (Only about Â£1.50 per day).
It's been around 47 degrees here during the day, but a continuous breeze has
made it entirely bearable.  
  
In the evenings we enjoyed copious amounts of food (and shisha for those who
chose to partake) with massive discounts due to the highly competitive
atmosphere. We then hit the cocktail bars and drinking and dancing commenced.
More than one person ended the night a little worse for the wear.  
  
During day eight we were driven to the Three Pools for snorkling which I
really enjoyed. Many many colourful fish and not-quite-healthy reef. Plus a
good amount of lazing about in the sun was indulged in.  
  
We're making the most out of not living on the road while we can.
