  sioc:content """I write this as a commitment to producing a number of useful things over the
next two weeks.  And I will read all of Jeremy Keith’s books.  And I will make
sure all of my sites validate, even the ones I did in a hurry.  And I will
rebuild my portfolio with HTML5, and for mobile.  
  
I’m going to start tomorrow.  Promise*.  
  
I’m now reading [this](http://diveintohtml5.org/).  
  
Things are being learnt.  
  
* Not a promise.  In all likelihood, tomorrow, I will spend several hours at Weirfield Wildlife Hospital cleaning up excretions of sick animals and loving every minute of it; followed by an afternoon and evening spent playing Mum to a certain parrot and consequently failing to do anything else.
