I made a list of things I hate:

* Studies that assume people are clueless wrt their online identity and social data management
* Studies that assume people are totally aware and make active conscious decisions about their online identity and social data management
* Studies that generalise to all social networks from facebook or twitter
* Studies that generalise to all people from one demographic
* When that demographic is western college students
* ..because that just means they couldn't make time/effort to step off campus
* Studies that assume people have a straightforward or one-to-one mapping with their social profiles
* Mining profile information to improve recommendations/advertising/marketing blah
* Mining profile information to infer attributes
* Studies that act like their results will still be meaningful in 6 months
* Anything that reduces humans to dots and lines (all SNA lol)
* Papers that assume there are technical solutions to all privacy issues
* Studies that totally ignore imagined audience or expectation of privacy (it's public so we can use it!)

I'm not saying I can necessarily do better, but I will at least refer back to this list and try...""" ;
