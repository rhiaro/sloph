# Swap-shop volunteer

## SHRUB: Swap and Reuse Hub Edinburgh

The [SHRUB](http://shrubcoop.org) is an awesome cooperative dedicated to promoting reuse, recycling, repairing and upcycling. I helped with early sorting-out of the new shop premises, made some shelves.. spent a few hours per week working in the shop in exchange for swap tokens which which I have procured all manner of exciting things, and helped with the big university halls cleanup last year. I regret that I've only managed to make it in a couple of times in 2015.""" ;
