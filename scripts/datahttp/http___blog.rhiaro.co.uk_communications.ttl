# Communications Officer, Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Society

## University of Lincoln

Ran the website, helped with socials, special events and regular meetings, made a paltry attempt at a society magazine (called The Bridge) but hardly anyone would write for it; did most of the dealing with the Students' Union because nobody else could be bothered.""" ;
