  sioc:content """Having finally found somewhere to live in London, I'm now looking forward to
returning to Google's amazingly brightly coloured office in Belgrave House.
The few hours I spent there during my interview left me with impressions of
comfy chairs, excitable people, and rubber ducks stuck upside down to the
ceiling. I also got a fleeting glimpse of the legendary canteen, which I'm
sure I will become very familiar with over the coming weeks.  
  
For those of you who don't know, my role as University Programmes Intern will
involve supporting the University Programmes team as they forge links between
Google Engineering and the academic world, throughout Europe, the Middle East
and Africa (read more about it
[here](http://www.google.com/university/emea/index.html)). It's a non-
technical role, but I'm hoping my technical background will be helpful in
relating to the technical people (students and academics) the team will be
working with.  
  
Here's to hoping I'm up for the task!
