  sioc:content """Another fantastically lazy day, with everyone doing their own thing. H went to
learn to kitesurf, and Al, Lizzie and I caught camels for half an hour to The
Blue Hole, a prime scuba diving and snorkling spot.  
  
My camel was distinctly tetchy and easily distracted,but overall highly
entertaining.  
  
I snorkled for a bit, but had a dodgy mask so it wasn't nearly as enjoyable as
last time. I think we were all a little underwhelmed by the Blue Hole. It
can't have helped that it was brimming with tourists.  
  
H joined us later and we lazed about, eating, drinking and sleeping until we
were collected at 5. For anyone still reading this because Chris pointed you
here, he was diving all day. You'll have to ask him about that.  
  
We regrouped for dinner at a classy looking Indian/Thai/Chinese place.  
  
At ten, six of us were picked up from the hotel on a minibus for our next
grand adventure...
