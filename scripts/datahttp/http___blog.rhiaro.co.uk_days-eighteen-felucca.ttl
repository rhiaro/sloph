  sioc:content """Our felucca was a small boat covered in a foam matress, a few cushions and
little else. There was a cabin at the front for the guys who were both sailing
the thing, and cooking our food.  
  
Thus, we lounged around.  
  
That is all.  
  
The toilet was amongst riverbank bushes, and the shower was the Nile. The Nile
is exceptionally refreshing, by the way. We moored for breakfast, lunch and
dinner; local food, prepared and cooked by the felucca crew, was among the
best we'd had on the trip.  
  
Lounging, for those wanting more detail, consisted of reading, writing,
sleeping, playing cards, listening to music, sleeping, reading, playing cards
and sleeping. This challenging routine was broken up by jumping into the Nile
and holding onto a rope that trailed behind the boat. Then climbing back onto
the boat to dry off in the sun and resume the lounging.  
  
The morning after the second night on the felucca, we had arrived about an
hour's drive away from Aswan. Nev picked us up with the truck, and we drove
all the way back to Luxor. En route, we stopped at Edfu Temple for an hour.
This quickly ranked as my favourite one. It was huge, plenty of places to get
lost in, and enormous walls covered in heiroglyphics.  
  
After lunch in Luxor, we spent a few hours at Rezeiky Camp (where we stayed
previously) thoroughly cleaning the truck. When that was done we headed into
town for dinner - more kushari! Without getting lost, this time.  
  
Back at the camp we jumped in the pool for a bit (the pool which is distinctly
more of a funny colour than the Nile, and into which you cannot see further
than a few inches). we cleaned up, packed everything, and headed to Luxor
train station, saying goodbye to Nev and the truck for the last time.  
  
An hour later than scheduled, the eight-hour overnight train journey
commenced.
