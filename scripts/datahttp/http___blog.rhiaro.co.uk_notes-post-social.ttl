# Notes post social-informatics seminar talk

methodology: iterative, inductive

ResearchGate > Academia.edu

Research in use of avatars

Where the good enough boundary lies for managing?
When is it dangerous, when serendipitous. What 'matters'?
No perfect model of social management/access control.

Easier to look at different systems doing the same thing in different ways
(things of a similar species)

Profiles shaped strongly by the needs of the service providers
Problems of their own survival are also played out in this space
Difficulties people may have managing profiles are sometimes down to easily fixable poor design things
Interests of people fight with interests of service
