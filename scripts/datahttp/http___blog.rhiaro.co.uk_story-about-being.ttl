  sioc:content """[13th August 2011]  
  
The grazes on Kip's palms stung, pressed tightly against the icy cold rock.
Water seeped into the belly of his tshirt and front of his tattered pants as
he scraped his body along the unforgiving stone. Though the crevasse through
which he crawled was getting smaller, he continued to inch onward.  
  
Kip had an inkling that his father's life depended on his progress, and the
several tonnes of grey rock closing in on him from every direction did nothing
to persuade him to give in. For the tenth time in as many minutes, the boy
swallowed his fear and crept forward another arms length.  
  
His breaths became shallower as space in which to expand his lungs decreased;
cheek pressed against stone, a single tear merged with the veins of water
already tracing the surface.  
  
He tried to move again, an inch, a millimetre. He squeezed his eyes closed and
pushed his head until his temples groaned, but the barrier would not yield.
