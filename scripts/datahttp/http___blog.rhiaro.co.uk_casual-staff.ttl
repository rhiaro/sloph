# 'Casual' staff (general dogsbody) in Marketing & Comms

## University of Lincoln Students' Union

I started on a 0 hour contract to deliver posters around campus. Then they found out I could use PhotoShop, so I started making posters too. *Then* they found out I could make websites, so I did that for minimum wage on a 0 hour contract for a couple of years, too. Mostly one-off sites for events and projects, sometimes in collaboration with other organisations. I also managed and over-engineered some Access databases, tried to make the best of what we had with an off-the-shelf CRM/CMS for the main SU website, and trained non-technical staff to use various administration systems.

Here, I learned to love flexible working hours and hate office politics, but never actually take advantage of either.""" ;
