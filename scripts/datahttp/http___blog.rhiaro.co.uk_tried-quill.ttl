Have you tried [Quill Editor](https://quill.p3k.io/editor)?

And you could generally ask around IWC about [various interfaces](https://indiewebcamp.com/create) other people are using and see if there's one you like. You can use different things for different types of post. I'm totally going to write a checkins client soon.""" ;
