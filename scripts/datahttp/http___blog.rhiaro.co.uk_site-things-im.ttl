This site things I'm in the middle of doing / have branches for:

* Auto likes and reposts to twitter using bridgy publish.
* Weekly summaries of post types and minutes/hours spent doing things.
* Expanding likes and reposts.
* Fixing /where
* Pages for vague locations.
* URLs to names for person tags.
* List of follows/subscriptions.
* Make various feeds discoverable.

[This weekend](https://indiewebcamp.com/2015/MIT), maybe I'll finish one or two of them, but I also might implement indieauth login for my site instead.""" ;
