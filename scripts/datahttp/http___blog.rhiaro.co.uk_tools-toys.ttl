  sioc:content """As expected, the first week flew by, with lots of small projects coming my way
as well as meetings scheduled about some bigger ones. I also finally got to
meet the rest of my team, who had been in Zurich at the [Anita Borg
Scholarship Retreat](http://www.google.com/anitaborg/).  
  
Google Calendar has become a tool impossible to live without. Whilst I'd never
previously used it with any seriousness, after two days at Google I can't
imagine ever planning my time without it again.  
  
Similarly the Tasks feature in Gmail has become invaluble, and I've started to
use it to remind myself about menial things to do in my personal life as well.
The trick is to write down something you have to do the minute you're asked or
emailed to do it. The list quickly became bottomless, but you can move things
up and down by dragging - so it's easy to prioritise, and of course there's
the satisfaction of a big tick _and_ a strike-through when a task is done.  

  

It also surprises me how quickly having meetings with people in other
countries has become normal. Video conferencing is seamlessly integrated into
the normal workflow, so you can either make a call from your desk for a quick
chat, or book a room (for the person you're calling, as well as yourself) for
a longer meeting. I've met the members of my team in Zurich and Vienna in this
way. (Still hoping I get to head out to visit them in person some time
though!)  
  
Other particularly memorable highlights of the week included hiding under a
desk, behind a giant red ball, waving toys in the air like puppets in the
background of a short video... For like, seven takes. Not in my job
description, but definitely fun. Plus the chocolate fountain the canteen.
Everyone seemed amazed at this, so I guess it doesn't happen often. There were
mini jam doughnuts to dip. I do love working here.  
  
But not just because of the food (although that is quite a contributing
factor. Seriously, the vegetarian chilli - twice - was awesome). I also love
how well interns are treated, and how I feel that the projects I'll be getting
started with next week actually have some sort of impact. I've made friends
with a group of other interns (mostly engineering ones) and I'm pretty sure
they all feel the same. We don't just get menial tasks to keep us out of
trouble, but hefty pieces of work that keep us interested and thinking.
