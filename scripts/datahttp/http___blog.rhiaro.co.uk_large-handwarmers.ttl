  sioc:content """One of the first useful things I crocheted were these extremely masculine
handwarmers.

The extremely soft and fuzzy wool was from Age Scotland I believe.

I used no pattern and had never made handwarmers before, so they came out far
too big.  Not to worry, at least you can fit a Tigo in them!

I just repeated *dc ch1* around, dc-ing in the gap left by the chain each
time.  I reduced a bit around the wrist area to shape it, but it wasn't
particularly effective.  I chained about four, instead of carrying on, to make
the gap for the thumb, then continued as normal.  One of them is shorter than
the other, because I didn't count anything.  
  
They serve their purpose though, and the lucky owner has even gone so far as
to wear them in public in the chilly heights of Appleton Tower.
