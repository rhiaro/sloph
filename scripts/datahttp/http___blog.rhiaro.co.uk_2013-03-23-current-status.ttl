  sioc:content """##### Travelling: YES

I'm at the [Resonate](http://resonate.io) new media festival in Belgrade.

##### Studying: YES

I started a PhD in the [Centre for Intelligent Systems and their Applications
(CISA)](http://www.cisa.inf.ed.ac.uk/) in Informatics at the University of
Edinburgh in October 2012. I'm looking at how Semantic Web tools might be able
to augment digital media creation by providing collaborative opportunities for
content creation and improving connectivity between creative projects. I'm
interested in decentralized social networks, and retaining control of and
making good use of personal data.

##### Writing: Sometimes

Gearing up for Camp Nanowrimo this April.

##### Working: YES and no

Tutoring and doing ongoing freelance work, but not taking on any new projects.
