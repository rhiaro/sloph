  sioc:content """For breakfast I had Tesco's own brand bran flakes, with soya milk.  
  
HAHA that's a lie.  I had a cupcake.  Orange sponge with a square of dark
chocolate in the middle.  
  
Homemade, so it doesn't count.  
  
Lunch was Linda McCartney sausages in my Mum's 'miracle bread' rolls that I
brought back from home a couple of days ago.  They have soya flour, and
linseeds, and all sorts of stuff.  Also in there was 'fresh' (actually week-
old) spinach, ketchup, tabasco sauce, hummus and a pinch of magic BBQ spice
mix.  And bancha hojicha (a Japanese green tea).  
  
[Then I made my own bread.  It wasn't altogether successful.
](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/04/my-first-bread.html)  
  
Over the course of the afternoon I drank a cold bottled concoction calling
itself jasmine tea from the Chinese supermarket (because whenever I go into a
Chinese supermarket I have to try a new weird drink).  
  
Dinner, then, was a sort of chilli bean stew, because I thought that would go
well with the weird bread...  
  
[Soak and boil dried kidney beans; skip this part for canned ones, and chuck
them in whenever].  
  
Boileth a quarter of a swede and large chunks of new potatoes with the kidney
beans, until everything is soft.

Meanwhile:  
  
Half an onion, two cloves of garlic, a courgette, a red pepper, broad beans
(frozen), a handful of tomatos and a handful of mushrooms into the wok to fry
until they looked mostly cooked.  Plus pinches of: Vegeta (which is a
particularly good vegetable stock you'll find in an Eastern European
supermarket); cajun spice mix; chilli powder; piri piri spice mix; garam
masala and mixed herbs, and let sizzle for a while longer.  Then Quorn mince
and a tin of chopped tomatoes, a good mix, and simmer for an indeterminate
amount of time (or until the other pan of boiling things is done).

Combine two pans of boiling/simmering things (ideally into largest pan).

Eat with bread and/or rice and/or a spoon.

Follow with more cupcakes and tea.
