# Coconut chocolate cake

I think CHI submission reviews coming in tipped me over the TODOs edge, I developed a powerful cake craving, but didn't want to leave my apartment/pyjamas so the natural outcome is... procrastabaking!

This was improvised, and I don't normally have much success with full-size cakes, but lack of other baking dishes left me with little choice. It turned out great! Maybe using US units of measurements is the secret after all.

![cake](http://rhiaro.co.uk/photos/151118_cake4.jpg)

All measurements approximate:

* 1 1/4 cups wholewheat flour
* handful of cocoa powder
* handful of coconut sugar (I have small hands and not a sweet tooth, you might want more)
* handful of coconut flakes
* teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil (I would have used melted coconut oil but I didn't have enough)
* juice of one small lime
* enough warm water to bring to cake consistency, about 1/2 cup I guess

Combined dry and wet ingredients separately, then mixed together. Baked for 40 minutes (with poking breaks at 20 and 30) at 350F.

For the chocolate coating:

* 1/2 cup melted coconut oil
* whatever drizzle of soy milk I had left.. uh 1/4 cup?
* half a handful of cocoa powder
* half a handful of coconut sugar

Stir vigorously over a very low heat to make it foamy and wonderful. When it cools it separates, so as soon as the cake is cooled, pour it over and immediately refrigerate. Still separated a bit, but tastes great.
