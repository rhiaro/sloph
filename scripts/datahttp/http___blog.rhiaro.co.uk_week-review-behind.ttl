**[How to write a literature review workshop](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/04/how-to-write-literature-review-workshop.html) on Monday.  
  
Got hold of Amateur Media book (2012) in the NLS, and started reading it.  Got
in trouble for having a pen instead of a pencil to take notes.  Oops. N00b
mistake.  
  
Did more GeoLit related stuff than PhD stuff.  Must try harder.  (Got a
funding application in and went to a [tech start-up panel / networking
event](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/04/starting-up-in-it-panel-
discussion.html) that was great).  
  
Fiddled with my lit review outline a bit, but didn't really accomplish much.
Officially behind schedule for finishing by the end of the month (was I ever
on schedule?).  MUST TRY HARDER.
