**Discussed my ideas and work so far with Dave Robertson, my second supervisor, in two meetings this week.  
  
[Here's a summary of some of my thoughts](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/08

**5th - 11th August**  
**  
**I worked on my thesis proposal.  But it was also [Young Rewired State week](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/08/young-rewired-state-in-edinburgh-yrs2013.html)!  
**  
****12th - 18th August**
