**Had a sensible conversation with Ewan about when I should stop reading and start actually producing something.  The answer is sooner, rather than later.  I'm aiming for a literature review that is "neither a first nor final" draft by the end of April.  I started outlining topics that should be in it, and began faffing about with LaTeX (and Markdown and Pandoc).   
  
Then started panicking and promptly quadrupled the amount of things on my to-
read list.  Oops.  I blame Matthew Rowe.  
  
I finished reading his first year review (2007) as well as his paper about
[Meervisage: Community-based Annotation for the Semantic
Web](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/03/notes-meervisage-community-based.html).
I compiled a massive list of more things to read from _his_ lit. review, and
then looked up what he's been doing since then.  A lot.  Mostly relevant.  At
the very least, interesting.  Damn.  Don't worry, I'll prioritise that list,
and don't aim to finish it before I start writing.  
  
Going to Serbia on Tuesday, for Resonate.io.  What should I bring back?  

  * Information about creative processes for digital artworks.
  * Anything to do with open data or decentralized social networking movements.
  * Potential case studies or people to work with.
  * ... to be discovered?

Had a chat with Russell of [Makur Media](http://www.makurmedia.com/) about
video metadata and ontologies for describing film/TV production processes.
We're doing some of the same research and keeping in touch is likely to be
mutually beneficial.  Note to self: Summerhall Cafe is nice and the food is
cheap; go there for lunch one day.
