# Autobiography

I magicked _Autobiography_ to my Kindle, but I haven't started reading it yet because I'm worried I'll cry from beginning to end due to the sheer beauty of the prose.

I'm looking forward to a spectacularly written yarn, designed explicitly to incite scandal and speculation.

I'll read it as fiction and fantasy, inspired by, but not based upon, real events.

I might relate too much, or regress back to my teenage years.  I think I'd enjoy/despise it best shut away from the world until it's over; always the case with the first listening of a new album.  I don't know when I'll have time or understanding of peers for that.  I'll try to schedule a few days.  Maybe I'll run away to Kerrara for a weekend on my own.""" ;
