# Co-organiser, Edinburgh Centre, Young Rewired State

Helped to organise the local centre, recruited participants in the run up; we got teams through to the semi-finals this time! The Festival of Code was in Plymouth this year, so most of our participants couldn't make the trip; organised a mini-alternative with Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen centres, in Dundee instead.""" ;
