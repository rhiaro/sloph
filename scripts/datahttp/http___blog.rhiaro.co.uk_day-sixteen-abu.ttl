  sioc:content """SOMEONE* ordered a wakeup call for everyone without telling us. At 4am, a
phone you don't recognise ringing next to your head from a table of all of
your charging electricals is one of the most confusing phenomena known to man.  
  
*It was Dave.  
  
We drove three hours to Abu Simbel and marvelled at giant representations of
Ramses II and his cohorts. The whole lot had been moved to save it from the
rising Nile a few decades ago, which is pretty impressive. At quarter to ten
we regrouped to join the return convoy (they don't trust tourists driving
alone in the desert).  
  
Lunch was even shadier than last night's dinner. There was no written menu so
the guy reeled off what he had. Not feeling particularly hungry, Kathryn and I
ordered spinach soup. It had the texture of dried spinach, herbs and garlic in
oil. Our resident professional chef (Al, for those of you not keeping up)
whisked it for a bit and concluded it was egg white. It tasted sort of okay
with bread dipped in. But I wouldn't recommend it.  
  
At 4, a local gave us a tour of Elephantine Island. The place is so chilled
out. There is an enormous sense of community and 'the simple life' amoung the
Nubian people.  
  
After dinner on the waterfront we went for an aimless wander that turned into
getting lost in the winding streets of Aswan. It was nice to see some entirely
tourist free areas, but we were also knackered. Eventual collapse at the
hotel.
