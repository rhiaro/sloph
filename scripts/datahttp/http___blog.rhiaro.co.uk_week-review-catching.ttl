Returned to Edinburgh on Wednesday.  Suffering from post-travel depression.
That's a thing, I looked it up.  It's a thing nobody has any sympathy for.
Life is hard.

  

Started and finished my [poster](http://rhiaro.co.uk/stash/amyguy_poster.pdf)
for the [Semantic Web Summer School](http://sssw.org/2013).

  

Went to Spain for aforementioned summer school.  Spain is hot.  Let this
mental week of learning begin!
