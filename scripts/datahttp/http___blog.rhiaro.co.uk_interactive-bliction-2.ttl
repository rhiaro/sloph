  sioc:content """> Investigate door.  
  
Your eyes are drawn again to the marks on the small door, and you squint,
taking a tentative step forward. A small cloud of powder rises around your
foot, and a floorboard creaks. The creak is low, and to you, sounds welcoming.
Like the house is inviting you in.  
  
Encouraged by this, you continue. You have to watch out for the things
cluttering the floor, and step carefully around an upturned plastic chair.
That obviously wasn't part of the original dÃ©cor, and despite the heavy
coating of dust, you assume it must have been left by the documentary crew.
Your foot clacks against something heavy.  
  
> Look at floor.  
  
The dust makes everything the same dark grey, but there are distinct shapes
that you can see. Several small plastic chairs are visible, laying on their
sides or with their legs pointing into the air. A standing lamp with a wide
shade has fallen over at the foot of the stairs, to your left. There's a knee-
hight rectangular box against a wall to your right, with what looks like a
padlock hanging from the front, and beside it lie pieces of a large and once-
ornate vase. At your feet is something long and narrow, and a glimmer of metal
peeks through the dust. When your foot made contact, it felt pretty solid. You
kick it again to roll it over, and dust peels away to reveal a brassy
candlestick holder.  
  
> Take candlestick holder.  
  
You pick up the object, about half the length of your forearm. The metal is
cool, but surprisingly not cold. Feeling like you need a souvenir, you tuck it
into your coat pocket, and continue to pick your way across the hall.  
  
> Inventory.  
  
In your coat pockets you have the candlestick holder, half a bar of Dairy
Milk, and the keys to your flat. In your trouser pocket is your mobile phone,
which is turned off so your friends won't disturb you, and some change.  
  
> Investigate door.  
  
The small door is in front of you, and to your left is the sturdy looking
bannister that runs up the side of the staircase. You could touch the
bannister and the wall to your right at the same time, if you stretched out
your arms. It's harder to see because you're no longer in direct line of the
light from the entrance (which you left open), but you lean to inspect the
front of the door. Cobweb trails curl around your finger tips as you run your
hand down the dark wood. You can feel carvings on the surface, and blow and
swipe at the dusty layer until the patterns are no longer so obscured.  
  
You suppress a splutter at the thick and itchy air you're breathing. Some of
the shapes carved into the door feel like cogs, but there's something else as
well. Something winding, with a shape more organic. You only wish you could
see all of the details.  
  
Your wandering hand finds a wooden protrusion at waist height, and you try to
turn the handle. It moves stiffly, but the door itself doesn't budge.
Carefully, you lean your shoulder against it and push harder, but to no avail.
