  sioc:content """So I was all excited about [block level links](http://html5doctor.com/block-
level-links-in-html-5/).  
  
But then Firefox had to go and [vomit the DOM all over the
place](http://remysharp.com/2009/08/10/defining-the-vomit-bug/).  
  
Which, incidentally, screwed with my layout somewhat.  
  
Everything else could handle it.  Including IE6.  Grr.  For the record, this
was Firefox 3.6.10, Windows and 3.6.13 on Mac.  
  
So I'll be keeping an eye on that one before trying it again.  
  
YAY FOR LEARNING!
