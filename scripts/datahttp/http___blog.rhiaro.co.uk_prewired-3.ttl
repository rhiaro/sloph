  sioc:content """Our third Prewired event went smoothly, with 20 young people (about 4 new) and
7 or so parents attending, plus 8 mentors. So lower signups than usual (a few
cancellations due to school commitments), but we decided not to do a big
publicity push and see how it ran with a smaller group. I didn't notice much
difference, since they organise themselves into smaller groups anyway to work
on different things. I think next time we'll try to reach our capacity of 40.  
  
We had a big group working on a variety of Python projects (games, basics,
algorithms, I'm not sure what else..), a small group doing front-end web, and
quite a few doing amazing things with Scratch.  
  
Every week I discover new things these super-talented young people are doing
with their time, and it won't be long before many of them are spending a lot
of time mentoring their peers as well as working on their own projects.  
  
[Nantas](https://github.com/edran) came by to talk about what he does with the
University's Robotics lab, including the challenges of making humanoid robots
play football, and the state of the art, two-million-pounds, full sized
humanoid robot that is moving to Edinburgh in the near future. Definitely
stuff to get young people excited about learning to code.  
  
We've been trying to encourage them to code between Prewired sessions, too,
and about half of them said they had. I hope by the next time all of them
have, and I'm really excited to see what they're capable of making in a few
months time!  
  
**But...**  
**  
**Some of the young people attending are disadvantaged by not being able to bring their own laptop, or having only _really_ old laptops which can't support modern browsers and therefore have trouble even executing the JavaScript their writing (true story).  
  
We'd love to be able to pay for a set of simple but up-to-date laptops that we
could lend to the attendees who don't have their own during sessions.  This at
least will put them on a level playing field with the others during the
sessions, and I suspect that many of them have adequate desktop machines or
family laptops at home.  
  
Prewired runs on a budget of volunteer blood, sweat and tears, and zero
pounds.  We're lucky enough to be able to use space in the University
Informatics building for free, and there are no shortage of keen mentors and
helpers willing to chip in their time (and in some cases cash for snacks).  
  
So if you work for a company who might be able to support the purchase of
resources for our young coders, or know someone who does, then [please get in
touch](mailto:Amy.Guy@ed.ac.uk)!
