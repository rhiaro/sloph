# Minimum Viable Micropub

> "**Micropub** is an open API standard that is used to create posts on one's own domain using third-party clients. Web apps and native apps (e.g. iPhone, Android) can use Micropub to post short notes, photos, events or other posts to your own site, similar to a Twitter client posting to Twitter.com." _([Micropub on Indiewebcamp](http://indiewebcamp.com/micropub))_

This means I can now publish blog posts to my site using other peoples' posting clients, of which there are [several](http://indiewebcamp.com/micropub#Clients). Previously, I was ftping markdown files to my server, then running a slightly unreliable PHP script to process the queue based on when the files were last updated. Which mostly worked, but when it didn't it was a pain to untangle.

## IndieAuth

I wasn't expecting to have a micropub endpoint any time soon because it needs you to be able to sign into your site with [IndieAuth](http://indiewebcamp.com/IndieAuth). Fortunately, thanks to amazing work of [aaronpk](https://aaronpk.com) and others, most of the legwork has been done here, and you can delegate your IndieAuth; in your site `<head>`:

    <link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth" />
    <link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/token" />

## Micropub

Then create a micropub script (eg. `micropub.php`) and make it discoverable in the same way:

    <link rel="micropub" href="http://rhiaro.co.uk/micropub.php" />

Initially I wanted my endpoint at `http://rhiaro.co.uk/micropub` and set an `.htaccess` rule to redirect to the PHP script. This doesn't work; POST requests can't follow redirects.

Next, here's a bare minimum PHP script to store things posted to your site with a micropub client. This just dumps the `POST` request to a text file, which is where I started to see if it would work. What I actually do now is turn posts and metadata into triples and insert them into my triplestore, but you probably don't want to hear about that :)

    <?
    // Tell client where I can syndicate to
    if(isset($_GET['q']) && $_GET['q'] == "syndicate-to"){
        header('Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
        echo "syndicate-to[]=twitter.com%2Frhiaro";
        exit;
    }
    
    // Check for post
    if(!empty($_POST)){
        $headers = apache_request_headers();
        // Check token is valid
        $token = $headers['Authorization'];
        $ch = curl_init("https://tokens.indieauth.com/token");
        curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
        curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, Array(
             "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
            ,"Authorization: $token"
        ));
        $response = Array();
        parse_str(curl_exec($ch), $response);
        curl_close($ch);
        // Check for scope=post
        // Check for me=http://rhiaro.co.uk
        $me = $response['me'];
        $iss = $response['issued_by'];
        $client = $response['client_id'];
        $scope = $response['scope'];
        if(empty($response)){
            header("HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized");
            exit;
        }elseif($me != "http://rhiaro.co.uk" || $scope != "post"){
            header("HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden");
            exit;
        // Check that something was posted
        }elseif(empty($_POST['content']){
            header("HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request");
            echo "Missing content";
        }else{
                   
            // DO YOUR THING HERE
            //  ie. insert post content and metadata into your store, write it to a file, whatever you do to add it to your site.
            // For demonstration purposes, let's dump the POST request into a file and return the URL of the file.
            
            $fn = "posts/".time().".txt";
            $h = fopen($fn, 'w');
            foreach($_POST as $k => $v){
                $data .= "[$k] => $v<br/>";
            }
            
            fwrite($h, $data); 
            fclose($h); 
            
            // Set headers, return location
            header("HTTP/1.1 201 Created");
            header("Location: ".$fn);
        }
    }
    ?>


I got this far by working through the instructions as part of setting up [Quill](https://quill.p3k.io), so that's a good place to start!""" ;
