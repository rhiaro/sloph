# Bugs bugging me on Slog'd

I'm supposed to be working, so instead I'm making a list of wee annoying bugs in Slog'd that I could and should fix fairly easily this weekend:

* likes, bookmarks and reposts appear in no particular order. Investigate.
* I now have one post that is a like *and* a bookmark (semantically: "this is great!" and "will read again/use later"). Including reposts, I don't see a hierarchy here, so I need to make it display appropriately as all of them. 
* There are a bunch of author and reply URLs in my store with extra http:// on the beginning due to an earlier posting bug. Clean up.
* Get author display picture and name from following link and looking for microformats (currently it has a placeholder image and URL).
* RSVP posts that appear in lists aren't marked up correctly (posts have start and end times, but really markup needs reshuffling so the *event* has start and end time).
* Shorten the lists on my homepage so they don't take so long to load. 
* Add most recent post and 'where' boxes to homepage.
* Page with a full h-feed of everything.
* Prev and next buttons on posts don't work.
* Replacing a post via Quill drops the published date.""" ;
