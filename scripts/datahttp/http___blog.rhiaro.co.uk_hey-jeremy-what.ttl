Hey Jeremy, what date did you decide for IWC Brighton? I felt like it was in June, but also that it coincided with Portland which is July, so now I'm confused. http://indiewebcamp.com/2015/Brighton is empty..

Also if you get a minute, could you give me the Mailchimp contact you mentioned?

Cheers!""" ;
