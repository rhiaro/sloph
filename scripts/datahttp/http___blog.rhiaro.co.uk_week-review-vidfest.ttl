  sioc:content """**20th - 26th May**  
**  
**Continued to work on literature review.  Nothing much to report.  
  
Went to MCM Expo in London and managed to find time (around non-stop merch
selling for TomSka and Eddsworld) to ask between 30 and 40 content creators -
a wide variety of ages, experience, types of content - about their process and
collaborative practices.  The thing they all had in common (I randomly picked
people as they were waiting in the two hour long queue to get autographs from
Tom) was that they all do what they do because the _love_ it, want to
entertain people, and if the could earn a living from it too that would be
amazing; but that's not why they do it.  For many it's the dream, but not one
they expect realistically to achieve.  
  
_That_ is why this is important to me.  Because everybody _should_ be able to
make a living from doing what they love*, and the technology exists to allow
it.  How _exciting_.  
  
* Unless they're really bad at it.  There's only so much technology can do.  But they should definitely have the chance to get good before caving in to a ninetofive that they're not totally passionate about.
