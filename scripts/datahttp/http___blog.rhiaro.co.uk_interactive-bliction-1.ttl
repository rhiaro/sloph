  sioc:content """You find yourself in the house, because you have been drawn to it. Not like
others, who went because they'd heard tales of haunting and wanted to prove
their worth, or those who blazed in with tape measures and calculators and
felt a right to value and analyse. Your friends are not of the type to make or
take dares, and they stay away from the looming building. They didn't know of
your fascination. And they would have done their best to distract you, had
they. You don't want distraction. You want to follow your instinct. It has
taken several years, and so much staring from afar, so much day-dreaming.  
  
> Cross the threshold  
  
Floorboards creak as you take that first tentative step onto the porch. Dry
leaves and partially disintegrated police tape crackle underfoot. A wrinkled,
yellowed sign had been stuck to the door, and now hangs from one corner only.
It warns of falling masonry and unsafe walls, but you know the house is as
sturdy as the day it had been built. You feel it in your gut.  
  
The place hasn't been properly sealed off for years. A rusted chain is thrust
around one of the oversize brassy door knobs, but there's no padlock in sight.
You have distant memories of the doors being nailed shut with enormous planks
of wood, but they are long gone.  
  
> Enter  
  
Your fingers touch the rough wood of the door, and immediately become one with
it. That is, a small splinter embeds itself within you, and you grimace. Then,
one deep breath later, you push.  
  
You're expecting a creak, but none comes. The door swings smoothly, as if
recently oiled (but you know that's not the case. You just know). There light
within comes only from the doorway, your silhouette looks blankly up at you
from the floor. You can make out the shapes of broken furniture, clutter, in
this hallway with no windows. As your eyes adjust, both they and your nose
pick up the layers of dust that coat everything. There were people in here
just last week - you'd seen the van outside, ghost hunters, filming a
'documentary' - and yet nothing was disturbed. Yours were the only footprints
in the grime on the floor.  
  
Gradually, your eyes adjust to the gloom, and a broad staircase has
materialised in front of you. It looks grand, far grander than you expected
from everything else you knew - felt - about the house. It, too, is coated
with dust, and the steps are broad in width, but look narrow in breadth. Like
you might have to climb them on tiptoe. In the wall to your left, a door hangs
off its hinges, and beyond the frame you can see only darkness. To the right
of the staircase, in the dim distance, you can make out another door. It's
smaller, and firmly closed. It's hard to tell from where you stand, but you
think you can make out intricate patterns carved into the wood. Or maybe it's
just cobwebs.  
  
You snuffle involuntarily as the dust tickles your nose. You've come this far;
not much point in standing around in the doorway all day.

_[So now you decide what I write next. Comment or tweet at me, and I'll go
with a majority. If no-one is reading this, I'll go with what I feel like when
the time comes. For the unfamiliar, reasonable commands would be things like
'go forwards', 'go left', 'go right'. Nothing too taxing there.]_
