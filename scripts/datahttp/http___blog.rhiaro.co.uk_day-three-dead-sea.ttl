  sioc:content """We awoke on a mountainside at around 7. So far nighttime has proved to be
uncomfortably hot, at least within a tent. Breakfast was french toast by
Heather and Kath. We packed up and set off,driving for ages to find a secluded
spot by the Dead Sea. We avoided the usual areas as the were populated by
local tourists. We changed into swimwear and scrambled down to experience the
30% salt water and apparently rejuvinating mud.  
  
The buoying sensation of the dense water was the perfect, effortless
suspension. The water was not as painful as I'd been lead to believe it might
be and I managed to avoid getting any in my eyes or mouth. Salt deposits
around the edge were pretty stunning and I would have happily stayed in the
warm water for longer than the time we had.  
  
Next stop was a town called Karak; apparently not the least nightmareish place
out there, particularly for navigating with a truck the size of ours. We had a
lengthy lunch (falafel pitta for me) and went to look for supplies for the
evening meal. Food was massively overpriced (we were probably lied to). We
visited an ancienr Crusader castle which turned out to be enormous and very
underrated. Entry was 1JOD which did not include the services of an
unavoidable local guide.  
  
We were off again, destined for our final stop of the day the Al-Alanbat
hotel. We were sweaty and tired and so delighted when the first thing we saw
upon dismounting the coach was a shadey pool.  
  
Everyone elso took a dip, whilst Helen, Al and I made no nonesense chilli with
beans, vegetables and soya mince. Twas tasty.  
  
Finally I had chance to JUMP IN THE POOL. It was dark by this time and the
pool was freezing to start with but the swim was heavenly. Although normal
water is somewhat disappointing after the Dead Sea experience.  
  
We hit the sack early in our makeshift dorm in what may be a hotel outhouse.
Insects and strange noises abound through the night. Always good for the night
before a 6am start..
