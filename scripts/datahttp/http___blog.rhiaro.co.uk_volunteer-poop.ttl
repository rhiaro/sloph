# Volunteer poop-cleaner

## Weirfield Wildlife Hospital, Lincoln

This is one of the best things I've ever done. Noteable achievements include:

* Weighing literally hundreds of hedgehogs.
* Carrying an adult swan and throwing him into a pond.
* Chasing hoards of ducklings around the hospital floor.
* Being covered in squirrels.
* Being dive-bombed by an insane magpie.
* Handfeeding many baby things.
* Discovering what noise stoats make.
* Catching pigeons.
* Putting a baby fox and a baby squirrel in an incubator together and watching them cuddle up omfgcutenessexplosion.
* Adopting [this bird](http://tigo.rhiaro.co.uk).""" ;
