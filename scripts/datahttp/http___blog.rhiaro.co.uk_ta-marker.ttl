# TA and Marker, Semantic Web Systems

## School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh

Same as last year, but with twice as many students. Tirelessly answered student emails, made a few supplementary materials, mostly got the feedback sent on time; was nominated for a Best Teaching Award ^^ Oh, also organised a hands-on workshop this year, because I generally disagree with lectures.""" ;
