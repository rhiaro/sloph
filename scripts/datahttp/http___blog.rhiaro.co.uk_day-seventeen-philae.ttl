  sioc:content """We were all excited by massive the lie in we got for a 9am start that morning.
We saw Philae Temple, with Hatshepsut's cool obelisk. Another place where
those darn Christians ruined a lot of carvings.  
  
After lunch on the waterfront, I slept for a few hours. It was good.  
  
We regrouped at 4 and took a boat to a beach on Elephantine Island. Took a dip
in the Nile and survived. It's clean and clear around Aswan, contrary to
popular rumour. We had a tour of a family home in the Nubian village, and
Mona, lady of the house, cooked us a fantastic dinner. The houses are made of
mud brick, but painted brightly and strategically in yellows, blues and greens
to maximise heat and light potential year round. The house we saw was also
enormous, even for a family of five. During the summer months, they all sleep
on the roof, but there are an excess of indoor bedrooms for guests, and two
huge reception areas. In the village, there are no locks on doors, and the
sense of community is such that friends can wander in and out of each others'
homes at leisure. While we were there we had a few drop-ins from neighbors and
local kids, including a woman who henna'd up everyone except me. Even Al got a
hardcore eye-pyramid thing on his arm. Manly :)  
  
An enjoyable and stress free day, in preparation for the next few days of
uber-chilling on a felucca...
