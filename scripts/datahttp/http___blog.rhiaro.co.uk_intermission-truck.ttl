  sioc:content """Overlanding means lots of driving, and driving means a vehicle. A vehice means
a confined space, which in turn means patience and cooperation. The Oasis
trucks are built to house 24 people, plus a tour leader and driver. We are
fortunate in that there have been only eight to nine of us in total on this
trip. We've been able to spread out,sleep across the seats and have had plenty
of storage space to ourselves.  
  
Storage is in an overhead rack and in space below which we access by removing
our seats. Seats are along the edge of the truck facing inwards. Beneath the
floor in the central walkway, food and various communal things are stored.
There is also a selection of books and games. The truck is air oinditioned by
means of entirely open windows. Plastic sheets roll down the side in the event
that it does need sealing. In our current location, these have a serious
greenhouse effect.  
  
When we tire of sitting or lying on the regular seats, there's the beach. This
is an open space behind and just above the truck's cab. It is usually both
really hot and windy up there and is a great spot for a view. It can get
violently bouncy up there on desert roads; of course we are strictly not
allowed up there whilst we're moving..  
  
When the truck stops, the kitchen unfolds. Sheets of metal surround a
blackened, gas-powwered hob, and cooking is generally done in a series of
enormous saucepans. The kettle is usually boiled over an open campfire for tea
and coffee. Stuff is prepared on a foldup table, and three washing up bowls
are ritualistically laid out (water, bubbles, disinfectant). Food is brought
locally or taken from the stash of tins or dried food on the truck. Cook
groups (pairs in our case) were assigned at the start and everyone pitches in
with their own washing up, which operates a lot like a production line and is
extremely efficient. Travellers may often be seen waving plates and pans and
cutlery around for minutes at a time. This is a highly sophisticated pot
drying technique known as 'flapping'.  
  
So far we've managed to not get in each others' way and have clicked
wonderfully. It doesn't take long to adapt to living like this and I think
adjusting back to 'normal' life may be harder.  
  
This trip, and my new friends, have opened my eyes to a world of new
travelling possibilities and cemented my desire to explore. When the time
comes, I won't be ready to come home; but when I do, I'll start planning my
next adventure.
