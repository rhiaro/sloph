  sioc:content """  
By sheer coincidence, I find myself neck-deep in creating a custom Interactive
Fiction engine during a year in which all kinds of new engines for authoring
and enjoying interactive narrative are popping up. Many of these by
established programming and literary experts in the IF community.  
  
It feels like every week [Emily Short](http://emshort.wordpress.com/) posts a
review of something new. Most of the ones I've seen recently are more of a
Choose Your Own Adventure format than parser-based. Nonetheless, there is a
lot I can learn about world modelling and code-free authoring from these
systems. Not all of them are open to the public for creating though. All of
them seem to be open to Emily Short, however, and she is doing a great job of
describing and reviewing her experiences.  
  
It occurred to me a while ago that creating the interface for authoring pieces
for Palimpsest is potentially more interesting and important than examining
the reader experience when it's all done. Readers are much more fickle, and
those who spend time writing and creating are by definition the committed and
passionate. I'm not saying the readers aren't. But a solid interface for
authoring is going to make it much more likely that good experiences for
readers are to be created. If I rush through the design and build of the
software itself so that I can focus on filling it with content then quizzing
readers about the immersiveness of their experiences - as was my original plan
- there's a good chance I won't spend nearly enough time testing with authors
(as I'll be doing the authoring) and will miss the opportunity to allow people
to create immersive or particularly engaging experiences, jeopardising the
outcomes of the user study stuff in the end anyway.  
  
I only have about two months left to work on this in the context of my MSc.
Whilst I need something substantial to fill my final report with, I'm certain
I'll be continuing to develop this in the future, and I'll only end up having
to redo bits from scratch if I cut corners the first time.  
  
I also have to think about what I want to get out of my MSc, and how I want to
use the opportunities I have studying in an art department compared to what
would be expected of me studying in a computing department.  
  
I jumped on the idea of 'user study stuff' because I know how to do this in
terms of software, and I know how to write a lot about it.  Not that I don't
find the immersion thing interesting, but overall I think it would be more
valuable to both myself and any eventual users of Palimpsest if I produced
documentation of detailed musings about the perhaps unfinished or forever-
ongoing development of a custom engine and authoring interface for Interactive
Fiction, rather than gloss over that to fill my report with lots of nice
statistics and quotes and analyses about reader experiences that are
ultimately invalid anyway.  
  
And I can _do_ this for an 'art' project, where the journey is equally, if not
more, important than the outcomes.  Where for a 'computing' project, the
documentation of the journey has in my experience generally been intended to
be a build up to an overarching theoretical or practical conclusion.  
  
So next up, look out for a discussion of the various engines for different
flavours of interactive narrative that have been popping up / I've been
noticing recently, coming soon to a blog near you!  (This one.  This is the
blog it'll be coming to.  Not any old blog near you).
