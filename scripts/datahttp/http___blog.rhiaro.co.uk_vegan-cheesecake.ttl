This month is the month I really start to concentrate on my thesis, so today I made cheesecakes!

All quantities thoroughly approximate, and blended on high speed:

* 2 cups cashews
* 3/4 cup lemon juice (freshly squeezed, 2.5 lemons)
* 1/4 cup coconut oil (melted, I've tried blending solid coconut oil before and it does *not* blend)
* drizzle maple syrup
* spash of almond milk

Augmented with a fruity layer:

* 2 handfuls blueberries
* 2 tablespoons applesauce
* 1 tablespoon coconut oil

In the freezer for a couple of hours, and they turned out pretty well. They are amazingly creamy and tangy. The real question is, why haven't I given up computers to make desserts full time?""" ;
