  sioc:content """At the Future of Web Design conference earlier this month, I was inspired.  As
a developer primarily and a designer when I have to be, the talks and people
at FOWD were perhaps more valuable to me than if my main focus was on design.
I don't need inspiration to develop, but I do to design.  
  
But an incredibly busy week and a bit later, I find I haven't had an
opportunity to really make use of the ideas that were triggered at the
conference; not only that, but the inspiration is beginning to fade.  And I
will struggle to find time to watch the talk videos over the next few weeks.  
  
I had intended to shove together a new portfolio site, to match my shiny new
business cards, before the first day of FOWD.  Naturally I didn't manage to
stick to this deadline, continued to work on the site during the conference,
and to this day the redesign remains unfinished at _localhost/_.  It is so far
responsive up to iPad dimensions, but the design that I was initially
satisfied with has fallen out of my favour, so I'm struggling to finish.  I've
been browsing collections of great web design, like
[this](http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/inspiration/trendy-web-design-interfaces-
deviantart/) one, as well as staring agonisingly at _localhost/_, hoping for
re-inspiration.  
  
Turns out I dislike quite a few of the designs on that list.  Some just have
too much blank space.  Many go _way_ overboard with the 'Web 2.0' look; glossy
buttons, excessive rounded corners, and the like.  Pretty on first glance,
perhaps, but after seeing so many sites in the same style, you suddenly
realise the genericness of them all; they give an impression of designers who
forgot that the purposes of, or the companies behind the sites have their own
personalities and branding that can't be represented simply with shiny buttons
and background gradients.  
  
I am currently a fan of textured backgrounds, and I'll confess I am currently
of the opinion that a text shadow automatically makes almost any header text
look better.  I'm sure this will wear off, just like glossy buttons did.  But
I'm still struggling to find a style that suits me personally (and matches my
business cards).  
  
So far, just writing about it has helped a little, and I think I have enough
beginnings of new ideas to push on.  Watch this space.
