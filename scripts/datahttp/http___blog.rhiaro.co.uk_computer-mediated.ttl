  sioc:content """I was fortunate enough to attend the [Computer Mediated Social Sense-
Making](http://cmssm2013.wordpress.com/about/) workshop, conveniently situated
on the ground floor of the building I work in, on the 14th of February.  
  
Whilst more technical than the [Digital
Methods](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/01/digital-methods-as-mainstream.html)
conference I went to in December, the talks and panel sessions served to build
upon things I started to think about then.  Namely, beginning to situate my
research interests amongst many concepts from the currently quite alien fields
of sociology and anthropology.  
  
The talks were varied, and key themes that emerged were the collection/use of
data for social improvement (health and wellbeing, teaching and learning,
disaster recovery), and the importance of context in making collected data
genuinely useful.  A notable challenge is that one piece of data might have a
thousand different contexts from the perspectives of a thousand different
human beings.  So how to communicate these variations to software that
processes this data, and perhaps makes decisions using it?  
  
Perhaps not to worry too much about that at all.  Process things locally
instead of globally, using local contexts and understandings, but make sure
everything is annotated such that information can still be exchanged across
the whole network, and differences in understanding can be accounted for or
reasoned out if a need occurs.  
  
For the record, I'm looking at how Semantic Web technologies could be used to
better connect human and machine in the context of amateur digital content
creation (movies, comics, music, art), including how semantically annotating
creative (often collaborative) _processes_ as well as the _end products_ of
these processes and the _engagement of an audience_ with these products, could
improve the overall experience of creating content (along a number of
dimensions).  A massive part of this will be creating tools that actually
collect the necessary data from users.  Ultimately, these tools will need to
be invisible, ie. easily integrated into existing online routines, with no
effort required to use them for the non-technically minded so that a network
effect can take place.  
  
Incentives for crowdsourcing came up during CMSSM, and someone pointed out
that by gamifying data collection for research projects, incentives become the
same as ones offered by gambling companies; something competitive and
potentially addictive.  I think things like global systems of reputation and
trust are useful on a network where people are to share data about their own
work (or opinions of the work of others) and may be nurturing a desire for
popularity or exposure on the network (a network where the _people_ are
central, because the data could not exist without them, but where the users
and the data are simultaneously co-dependant).  
  
Anyway, I'm still brainstorming.
