I want to completely run my calendar from my website, even if it's just as a series of RSVPs. I think tomorrow at HWC I'll scope out exactly what I do for this to happen. Off the top of my head, I need:

* Restricted access to event details (potentially just by obscurity).
* Reoccurring events.
* Inviting people, or at least tagging people I expect to be there.
* Better location display.""" ;
