[@synvila](http://twitter.com/synvila) If you haven't seen [indiewebify.me](http://indiewebify.me), that's a much less daunting starting point. And [IndieMark](https://indiewebcamp.com/indiemark) might be helpful for breaking stuff down. More links to things to read, I know... Hopefully worth it though :) You never have to do 'everything', just pick and choose what meets your needs. """ ;
