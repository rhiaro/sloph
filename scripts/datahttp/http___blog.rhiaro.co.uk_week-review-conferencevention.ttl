  sioc:content """**1st - 7th April**  
**  
**On Monday and Tuesday I'd blocked out 'PhD' time on my calendar, but what was I _doing_?  I do make a point of updating my calendar with hindsight so it doesn't contain lies.  I must have done _something_.  
  
On Wednesday I jetted off to exciting Newark, then on Thursday I was in
Nottingham for the Lovelace Colloquium ([and had a fabulous
time](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/04/inspiring-and-empowering-
lovelace.html)).  Friday to Sunday saw me running around in circles for
GemuCon.
