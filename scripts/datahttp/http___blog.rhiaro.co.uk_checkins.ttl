# Checkins

When is it a checkin (with a note) and when is it a note (with a location)? Hot topic. I differentiate them for display purposes (currently I just show a map-marker icon next to checkins, but I'm also going to want to show them on a map and stuff).

For now, my rule is:

* If a post has a `location` property, which should be a URL of a place (venue/city/country/vague), it's a checkin.
  * A checkin *may* have a `latitude` and `longitude` (my vague checkins, eg. 'home', do not).
  * A checkin *may* have `content`.
* If a post has a `latitude` and `longitude` and *no* `location`, it's a note with a location.
  * A note *should* have content.

My inner semantic pedant is unhappy with attaching a lat and lon to a post directly, so I might rethink this at some point.""" ;
