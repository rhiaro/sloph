Felt thoroughly rubbish after last extended-but-interrupty nap, but 30 minutes just now really helped. I had a few vivid dreams - one about being climbed on by a massive cat, and one about waking up, checking my phone and seeing it was after 3pm and panicking, then realising my eyes were closed so I couldn't be checking my phone and must still be asleep - which means I was in REM (success).""" ;
