definition.html))  
  
[This one was tough. Two two-hundred-word false starts, at least twenty four
hours of unproductivity and a session on [750words](http://750words.com/) to
force extraction of every thought that drifted through my mind, however
insignificant, later...]  
  
[Disclaimer: All persons and scenarios portrayed her are fictional, and any
resemblance to real people and places is entirely coincidental.]  
  
Life circumstances twisted and turned, times changed, redundancies occurred,
and one way or another, I found myself living with my mother again. I'd been
back in the family home for two whole weeks before I became suspicious. The
house routine had changed little in the years I'd been away. My mother worked
her way through consistent mountains of laundry and ironing, courtesy of my
siblings. She cooked and cleaned and tended the garden. She complained that
the house was always a mess and that she never had time to read or play the
piano. She claimed to relish rainy days because she could resist the allure of
the outside world, and do chores in the house.  
  
She incorporated my laundry into the household cycle and it was easy to let
her take over. She ironed clothes of mine that I hadn't ironed in years,
insisting it was necessary. She was critical in conversations with neighbours
and family friends about having to 'look after' me again now I was home, but
wouldn't let me cook for myself and swore she loved having me around the
house.  
  
She was at home all the time during the summer. She had a job change to look
forward to at the beginning of the next school year. It involved fewer hours
and less responsibility. To her, this was a promotion, and she frequently
mentioned how much she anticipated creating a new routine around her work,
finishing chores in the afternoons and having weekends free for gardening and
baking.  
  
Her hobbies truly were the household tasks, and she was always engaged with
them. But she was right. The house _was_ always a mess. Not dirty, just
untidy. Disorganised, cluttered, in a way that is entirely excusable for a
family with toddlers, for example. It had been in this state for my entire
life, so it took a while for me to notice. I confined my own mess to my
bedroom, and my slothful brother and workaholic sister had organised their
lifestyles to create barely a ripple in our mother's day-to-day running of the
home. So as a lifelong and proud homemaker with near-enough grown up
children... why wasn't every room spotless? I'm not just criticising. She
regularly bemoaned this fact. She had time and inclination and no-one to
hinder her. In addition, the hours she spent in the garden resulted in fresh
vegetables and endless fresh floral arrangements in the kitchen. Yet the
garden was in a similar state of disarray to the house. There were weeds; vine
plants spreading well beyond their allocated area; paving slabs misaligned;
borders overflowing onto footpaths.  
  
I reiterate that I never had a problem with this habitat. The place was homely
rather than cold and inhuman as an immaculate room can be, and the garden had
character. I was simply baffled by her unexplainable inability to control this
entirely normal environment, despite an obvious desire to do so.  
  
That's when I started to wonder if my mother was not all she appeared to be.
The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that she was
concealing something.  
  
From my bedroom window one morning, I watched her make her way slowly down the
garden path, stopping every now and again to turn the head of a flower, or
pull up a weed. She made it to the vegetable patch at the bottom of the garden
and spent five minutes hunched over the cabbages; I assumed, picking off the
caterpillars.  
  
Then she vanished.  
  
I blinked, and squinted at the spot where she had been kneeling. There was no
corner for her to have disappeared round, and no mysterious hole in the earth
through which she could have fallen. I figured if I was ever going to find out
what was going on, now was the time.  
  
I noticed nothing unusual as I approached the vegetable patch. Crouching down
in the same place my mother had been, I peered at the leaves of the first
cabbage, mostly shredded to lace by the caterpillars that were creeping over
the surface. I remember thinking how big some of the caterpillars seemed to
be. Then how big the cabbage was, then all at once the ground beneath me had
transformed from soil to some kind of soft, green, fibrous fabric.  
  
I froze as I realised I had materialised in the midst of a hub of bustling
activity. People... creatures... flurried around me, mostly carrying things,
sometimes dragging things. Seconds passed, and my presence didn't appear to
have altered anyone's course so I relaxed a little.  
  
Ahead of me, the green expanse stretched out for perhaps a mile before the
ground started to curve upwards, becoming almost vertical before disappearing
from view into a tangle of vine-like tendrils. The surface itself was divided
into sections by smooth, pale green elevations that looked a bit like really
long, curving speed bumps, and it was between - never over - these divisions
that the residents of this populous land scurried. And as for those
residents... My first assumption had been that they were oversized bugs, but
surreptitious closer inspection made apparent various more humanoid features,
exaggerated into insect-like shapes. Human hands on the end of an elongated
arm with a backward elbow joint; an extra pair of otherwise perfectly ordinary
jean-clad legs; shining organic body armour; curling antennae; uncomfortable
looking food pipes replacing noses and mouths. I observed all of this as an
aside, however, as my primary focus at that moment was locating my mother, who
I assumed had to be here somewhere. Seeing nothing in the immediate vicinity,
I rotated one-hundred-and-eighty degrees and was confronted by an infinitely
more explorable landscape. I appeared to be at the end of an enormous
driveway, lined on either side by slim, but unsymmetrical, strips of partially
polished tree bark. Each strip was about twelve feet tall (twelve feet, that
is, relative to my current scale) and angled a little outwards. At the end of
this driveway stood a grand, turreted structure; immense, green, and in
places, shimmering. It was a palace for sure, and it was in that direction I
headed.  
  
Surrounding the entrance there were no guards, just an increase in the density
of busy looking individuals. I crept through easily, taking care not to bump
anyone, and entered through an open archway. This entrance hall was at least
the size of a football field and had a floor of polished tiles which contained
animated patterns of swirling green and white. Matching flights of similarly
extravagant stairs to my left and right spiralled upward to meet a balcony
above the doorway, and above my head. A small and oddly proportioned crowd was
gathered at the other side of the hall, and in the centre of them I could see
the back of a familiar head. I darted left and climbed a little, both to hide
behind stair railings and to gain a better vantage point from which to watch
the scene before me unfold.  
  
My mother was flapping and flustering and apparently issuing instructions to
those around her, as every few seconds a creature would stand to attention and
scuttle off purposefully, and mum would relax for a moment. I wanted to hear
what was being said before I made my presence known. At the top of the stairs
it became apparent that the balcony continued inside the walls of the room,
and was connected to an opening at the top of another flight of stairs I could
see further in, almost above my mother and her entourage. This passageway was
unlit, and I encountered no opposition. I stuck my head out of the final,
smaller, doorway, and was able to hear everything. But by this time, only five
insect-men remained, and she appeared to have finished her list of commands.
She had had a list, as well. I saw her tucking it into her apron's front
pocket, before sighing, placing her hands on her hips, and surveying the room.  
  
"I _wish_ that mess was cleaned up," she tutted, frowning at a vase in the
corner. The vase had been upturned, and shards of porcelain poked out from a
heap of soil and scattered petals. Muddy water was starting to pool across the
glossy floor.  
  
Nothing's different then, I started to think; she still hates untidiness here,
but still can't find the time to cl... But it was clean. My mum was leaving
the chamber, entourage in tow, through a small doorway nearby, and the vase
was intact again, back in place upon its table. Jaw still hanging, I scrambled
down from my hiding place and crossed the now deserted chamber to peer through
after her.  
  
Her pace was fast, and she was almost at the far end of a dimly lit corridor
by the time I got there. Her posse and she turned a corner and the light
disappeared completely; I ran on tip-toes to catch up, and realised that the
green glow illuminating the area around her was provided by the bulbous rear
end of one of her minions. Keeping my distance, I followed the now silent
party through corridors for a few more minutes. They stopped, and I couldn't
see why until I heard the turning of a key in a lock, and a heavy sounding
door creaked open. They entered swiftly and the door clicked closed; there was
no way I could have manoeuvred through it in that time without being seen. I
contented myself with peering through the amply sized keyhole.  
  
The room beyond was high-ceilinged and decorated with luxurious red
upholstery. Several of the squishiest looking armchairs I have ever seen were
arranged around an empty fireplace, and a huge and intricate tapestry adorned
one wall.  
  
"I _wish_ someone had arranged my cushions for me," I heard my mother whine.
Nobody in the room moved, but a satisfied smile appeared on her face, so I
could only presume the cushions had just arranged themselves. She slumped into
one of the chairs and groaned "there's a whole _stack_ of old books that need
sorting out and getting rid of, that bookshelf is just _overflowing_ with
junk."  
  
The bookshelf in question was also out of my sight line, but three bin liners
appeared behind my mother's chair, packed full of angular objects that looked
suspiciously like books. One was labelled 'Charity Shop', one 'Car Boot Sale'
and one 'Recycling'. One of the insect-men who had been on standby reached for
them all with three of his six arms, and heaved them over three of his six
shoulders.  
  
I leapt back from the door as he approached and spun around, backing against
the wall and holding my breath. If he saw me, he gave no indication, and
continued down the corridor, back the way they had entered.  
  
I pressed my face to the keyhole once again, in time to hear my mother
complain that a fire had not been prepared nor lit, and to see one spring into
life in the fireplace. She leaned back into the chair and reached around to a
coffee table by her side. Her hand met with a bare glass surface and she
moaned. "Oh, no-one fetched the post in!"  
  
A stack of unopened mail materialised on the table, and she flicked through,
extracting a magazine sealed in plastic wrap. The wrap was removed, tossed
aside, and taken care of by a plea for her floor to be litter-free. I heard
her slowly turning the pages of the magazine, and decided I'd seen enough.  
  
That explains everything, then.
