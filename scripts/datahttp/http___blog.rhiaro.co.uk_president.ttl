# President, SocieTea

## University of Edinburgh

At SocieTea we sit around on Thursday evenings and drink fancy teas, make tea puns, and don't force anyone to socialise who doesn't want to. I'm proud to have facilitated this. Even though I'm no longer in charge, I still host a suitcase of tea, cups and saucers, and a tea urn, under my desk in my office.""" ;
