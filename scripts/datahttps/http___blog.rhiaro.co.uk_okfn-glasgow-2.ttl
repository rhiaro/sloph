<http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/okfn-glasgow-2> as:content """I ventured to Glasgow for the second Open Knowledge Foundation meetup on
Monday 18th. It was well attended, and there were six short talks:  
  
Lorna Campbell from Cetis talked about Open Scotland. I understood this to be
a collaboration between Cetis, the SQA, JISC and the ALT Scotland, to do with
the opening up of education, and influencing policy and practicein this area.
[Here's a blog](http://openscot.wordpress.com/).  
  
Grianne Hamilton from JISC talked about Mozilla's Open Badges. You can use
them to reward learning, skills and achievements in all sorts of areas, and
any organisaiton can create and issue badge packs to people who have earned
them. Recievers can then show them off anywhere they can put HTML.  
  
Graeme Arnott talked about a collaboration between Glasgow Womens' Library and
Wikimedia, which resulted in the Scottish Women on Wikipedia event. This was a
group of Scottish women getting together to edit Wikipedia articles about
Scottish Women, and there was very positive feedback. They have more events
planned. Graeme also reminded us about Wikimania, which is taking place next
August in London.  
  
Jennifer Jones told us about the Digital Common Wealth project. She pointed
out that with media-saturated global events like the Olympics, the official
story is already decided before the event even starts. An alternative to
relying on what is broadcast by the mainstream media is to turn the camera on
the crowd, and get the 'real' version of what is going on. The Digital Common
Wealth project will encourage citizen journalists to work together to craft
the story of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games from their perspective. Jennifer
also raised the point that although free tools like YouTube, AudioBoo and
Twitter are great for spreading stories, the data is still held by third
parties - what happens if they disappear? How should initiatives like this
safely archive their stories, and keep them in context?  
  
Pippa Gardner talked about Glasgow's Future Cities project, for which they
have Ã‚Â£24 million to develop. It's about "people and data", but she was here
to talk about data. There's the Data Innovation Engagement (which apparently
needs a better acronym) and [Glasgow's data
portal](http://data.glasgow.gov.uk/) which has already launched. Not all of
the data on their is 'properly' open, but it's more open than it was before.
There's a maps portal coming soon. Follow
[@openglasgow](http://twitter.com/openglasgow) to keep up to date. Someone
asked how they can avoid inadvertantly widening the digital divide by making
all this data available - as it will only improve things for people who
already have understanding and access. Pippa said there's a dedicate group in
the Council working on widening digital participation, so they're involved.  
  
Duncan Bain, and MPhil student at the University of Edinburgh, talked about
Open Architecture. He says it's hard to define 'knowledge' and 'data' in
architecture; architects create drawings/representations, not buildings. There
are efforts towards opening certain aspects of this, like wikihouse.cc and the
Open Architecture Network, but the culture of the architecture world, and
where the money is, seems to be preventing things from going in the same
direction as software development any time soon.
