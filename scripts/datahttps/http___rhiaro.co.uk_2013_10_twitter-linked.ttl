# Twitter to Linked Data

Or perhaps more generically, Status to Linked Data.  But Twitter is the only thing I update with statuses, so I'll start with that.

I want to be able to:

1. Parse the whole backlog of my tweets and turn them into Linked Data along the same schema as my blog posts will be.
2. Tag all tweets with the same tagset that my blog posts use, automatically from hashtags or keywords, followed by a manual second pass.  The mapping of hashtags and keywords to tags for the 'automatic' tagging will be done manually, I should think.  This, then, needs a nice interface.
3. Shove all that into the same triplestore my blog uses.
4. Integrate status updates into my kanban-style website, alongside blogposts.""" ;
