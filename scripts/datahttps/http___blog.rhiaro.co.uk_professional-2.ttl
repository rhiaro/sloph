**Speaker:** Roy Isbell  
**Area:** Digital security  
  
Depending on your point of view, you can probably claim the company you
started was successful if it is eventually bought out by a global giant, such
as Symantec. Roy certainly had this air of success about him as he told us
about the route he'd taken to get where he is today. But he didn't dwell on
his life story for the entire hour as we half expected. Instead he gave a
thought provoking presentation about digital security issues, from their
origins in the days when losing your data was the biggest concern, to modern
day crackers, malware and botnets.  
  
He emphasised how much of a profitable growth industry digital security is,
from both the point of view of those trying to breach the security, and those
trying to prevent the breaches. Roy mentioned that the UK government has
recently allocated Â£8 million to cyber security but a quick search* yielded
nothing to back this particular claim up... Instead I found [articles from as
recently as this afternoon about the Â£1 billion that will be spent on this
issue](http://www.infosecurity-us.com/view/13248/uk-government-to-spend-1bn-
on-cybersecurity/), as well as quite a few statistics that reinforce
everything else Roy had to say about the activity and effectiveness of
botnets.  
  
So although I'd heard of most, if not all, of the buzzwords that came out of
Roy's presentation, I'd never really _thought_ about them. That's not entirely
true. I use free anti-virus software and common sense when I'm browsing.
Goodness knows data security was hammered into all the new Google interns on
the day they handed over our shiny new MacBooks. But when you log into your
Internet banking from your own laptop, what could possibly go wrong? How can
this textbook company you've never used before, that you're putting your card
details into right now, possibly not be legitimate? Why would a stranger in
Russia be interested in logging my keystrokes? It's one of those... _It'll
never happen to me_ situations.  
  
I paid attention though, because although I've never really built a web
application big (powerful, used, important) enough to warrant anything more
than sanitising database entries before, I will be doing this year. So I
should probably get wise to this network security stuff.  
  
  
*A search of thirty seconds or less being all the multi-tasking, attention-deficit 'Internet generation' of today are capable of.
