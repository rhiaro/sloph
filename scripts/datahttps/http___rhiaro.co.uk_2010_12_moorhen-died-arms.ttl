  as:content """It was sad indeed.  Plus the hoard of ducklings is now down to seven.  (There
were nine, last time I was in, and they started at ten).  Apparently they can
die from being too wet.  Who knew.  
  
I also encountered this morning: a pigeon who held his head upside down and
walked in circles.  He had issues.  And a flightless canary, who seems healthy
in all other aspects.  Maybe heâ€™s just awkward.  But because of this, it
doesnâ€™t look like heâ€™s fit for the outside aviary.  If I didnâ€™t think Tigo
would eat him, Iâ€™d adopt him in a second.  
  
Speaking of Tigo, he seems to be exhibiting nesting behaviour:

I think he might be hormonal.  It would certainly explain the sudden increase
in biting.  
  
PS. Yesterdayâ€™s prophecy came true.  Quelle surprise.
