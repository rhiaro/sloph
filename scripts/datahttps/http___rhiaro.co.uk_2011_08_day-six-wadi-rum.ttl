  as:content """Helen, Chris and I made scrambled eggs and beans for breakfast before we
packed up camp and drove the short distance to the Wadi Rum visitor centre. It
was the first day of Ramadan, but one shop and the restaurant were still open
to sell food and drink to tourists.  
  
We enjoyed the air conditioning, drinks and sandwiches for a couple of hours
before a local guide arrived in a 4x4 to show us round the most famous sights
in the Wadi Rum desert. We stopped at some choice climbing spots - heads up:
desert rocks are hot!  
  
We also investigated Lawrence of Arabia's old hangout, some water control he
helped the locals build,and many ancient inscriptions in rock. We stopped at a
Bedouin camp where we were guided through a small sheltered gorge by an
enthusiastic nine year old, who presented each of us individually and at
carefully chosen moments with gifts of small pebbles. On our return to his
tent, his family made us a delicious herby tea and showed great hospitality.  
  
We drove to the port town of Aqaba which looks pretty modern and appears to be
constantly under construction. There was a nice beach but it was far too
conservative a place for us to enjoy properly that afternoon. We chose a
Syrian restaurant for a drink (about fifty percent of places were closed
because of Ramadan) and ended up eating there as well. Portions in the Middle
East are huge and we all ended up bloated. Good food and great juices.  
  
We borrowed MacDonalds wifi for a little while before preparing to board the
ferry. Our access to the ferry consisted of one deck of seating and two levels
of outdoor decks. Most people attempted to sleep,with varying success. I didnt
even try.  
  
We reached land ahead of schedule but made up for that by waiting outside the
immigration office for a few hours whilst staff did everything but their jobs.
We were sitting in pretty grimy sand; a lucky few passed out and awoke when
the sun came up. Nuweiba in the daylight was a sight for sore eyes. I may even
go so far as to eloquently describe the place as an absolute shithole. Pro
tip: the public toilets there are great - approaching them has the effect that
you suddenly realise you can actually hold it for another two and a half hours
after all.  
  
So my first impressions of Egypt weren't the best as we travelled to Dahab.
Again, most people used this journey for sleeping but I neglected to.  
  
Continued on day seven...
