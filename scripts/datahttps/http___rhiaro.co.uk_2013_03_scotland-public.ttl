  as:content """[Tell Me Scotland](http://tellmescotland.gov.uk/) publish public notices for
things like traffic, planning permissions... And they have a [SPARQL
endpoint](http://opendata.tellmescotland.gov.uk/)!  
  
I'm hacking around with the ultimate goal of creating an interface that allows
people to generate a GeoRSS feed for a particular area.  Ally of
[GreenerLeith](http://greenerleith.org.uk/) suggested this, so that they can
use this to feed into their own apps.  A stage beyond that is to smoosh the
whole lot into a Wordpress plugin, to make it accessible to anyone (who uses
WP).  
  
[So far I've got the notices on an
OpenStreetMap](https://rhiaro.co.uk/publicnotices/map.php).  I haven't had a
whole lot of time, but will make more soon.  
  
I'm using the PHP library ARC2 to deal with the linked data.  
  
NB. the TMS endpoint is, at the moment, flaky at best.  I think they're
working on this.
