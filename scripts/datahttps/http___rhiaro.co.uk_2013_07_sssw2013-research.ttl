_  
__Sunday_  
  
Arriving by train into Cercedilla, north of Madrid, we immediately encountered
other confused looking folk with poster tubes.  So we shared taxis (EUR 10)
from Cercedilla station to the summer school residence further north, in the
forest.  
  
After getting keys for our pleasant, single, en-suite rooms, arrivals
congregated in the shade by the building  to introduce ourselves.. Again, and
again, and again, as new people continuously arrived over the space of a few
hours.  
  
A _really_ broad mix of people are here in terms of nationalities and places
and levels of study, but I still haven't quite got used to the fact that
answering 'Semantic Web stuff' is not specific enough in this crowd, when
someone asks you what your research is about.  Nobody needs convincing that
these technologies are useful!  
  
Later we received schedules, maps, ill-fitting t-shirts* and very helpful name
badges, and headed for dinner at the bar down the road.  
  
As is traditional when I write about my experiences in new places, I will
describe the food every day.  It has become apparent, at this residence at
least, that variety of ingredients is not ordinary, so in this respect meals
are simple.  Dinner that first night started with a salad (lettuce, olives,
tomato, onion, shredded beetroot and a single slice of hard boiled egg; no
dressing), followed by - for the majority - slices of meat (beef? Pork? I
dunno..) and fries.  Mine was a plate of mushy green vegetables with a little
seasoning, that was pretty tasty.  Dessert was a single pear, delivered with
ceremony, but otherwise unadorned.  Healthy, at least.  
  
Yet we were all (those I sat with at least) were left feeling a little
unsatisfied.  
  
I shared a table with a French, Spanish, Italian and Irish guy.  Conforming
appropriately to stereotypes, and setting up reputations for the rest of the
week, the French and the Italian shared the bottle of wine on the table; the
rest of us went without.  
  
I returned to bed after a couple of hours of socialising and enjoying the cool
air in and around the bar.  
  
* For next year, they could ask for t-shirt sizes when they ask for dietary preferences?  
  
_Monday_  
  
The day started early, and with no hot water or wifi for anyone.  Breakfast
was combinations of sweet pastries, coffee, tea, juice and bread.  
  
Punctuated variously by coffee breaks, the learning began in earnest.  
  
During the introduction by Mathieu D'Aquin, I found out that I am one of 53
students selected out of 96 applicants to attend this year's Summer School of
the Semantic Web!  I had no idea it was that selective, or that there had been
that much competition.  
  
The first keynote was by Frank van Harmelen, about all the Semantic Web
questions we couldn't ask ten years ago.  
  
Slides:  
  
  

** [Semantic Web questions we couldn't ask 10 years ago](http://www.slideshare.net/Frank.van.Harmelen/semantic-web-questions-we-couldnt-ask-10-years-ago) ** from **[Frank Van Harmelen](http://www.slideshare.net/Frank.van.Harmelen)**

  
Frank started by saying that the early Semantic Web vision has morphed into
the more manageable vision of a Web of Data, or a Giant Global Graph, and
outlined the principles of the Semantic Web as they appear to stand at
present:  
  
1\\\\\\\\. Give everything a name (entities).  
2\\\\\\\\. Relations form graph between things.  
3\\\\\\\\. Names are addresses on the Web (so we inherit properties of Web like AAA).  
4\\\\\\\\. Add semantics.  
  
Frank pointed out the advantages of the fact the Linked Data crowd, grown
naturally and not designed, is now so big we don't know how many triples it
contains, nor how fast it is growing.  Companies and organisations (like
Google, NXP, BBC, DataGov) are using Semantic Web technologies to achieve
their own ends, for a variety of different use cases, without caring much
about the Semantic Web, and this is contributing to the growth.  
  
This growth has given rise to a number of research areas that were impossible
to realisitically ask questions about ten years ago, including self-
organisation, distribution of data, provenance, dynamics and change, errors
and noise (how to deal with disagreements).  
  
Frank asserted that rules and structures, algorithms and patterns in data,
exist whether we are looking at them or not.  He used the analogy that OWL is
our microscope, and it may be the tool that distorts our vision of the
information universe rather than properties of what we are looking at (for
example, structures in data presenting themselves well in some domains but not
others).  
  
He went on to promote the roll of the Informatician to be to test theories,
hypothesis and falsify, as scientists rather than engineers.  To discover,
rather than build.  
  
I struggle with this view of the world, and feel instinctively that theory and
practice are intrinsically linked; one can't exist without the other, not just
in the grand scheme of things, but in day to day work and research.  This is
one of the main points of contention with my own PhD, and I've no doubt there
will be many more blog posts about this issue in the near future as I
reconcile my need to create something immediately useful with the necessity of
producing a contribution to knowledge at large.  
  
See my [raw notes here](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/07/notes-frank-van-
harmelen-at-sssw2013.html).  
  
We had an Introduction to Linked Data by Mathieu D'Aquin ([raw notes
here](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/07/notes-introduction-to-linked-data-
at.html)), followed by a workshop.  We wrote SPARQL queries to populate a pre-
written web page with information about Open University courses, sub-courses
and locations thereof.  
  
Lunch, similar to the previous night's dinner, was a starter salad, an entire
half chicken (or something) plus fries for the carnivores and the most
unappealing risotto of my life for (not that I'm ungrateful, but I have never
been unable to finish a meal due to _boredom_ before).  I went for a walk with
some others to grab some fresh air before the afternoon's work, and missed out
on watermelon.  
  
Manfred Hauswirth presented some really exciting stuff about annotating and
using _streams_ of data.  Particularly challenging is how to integrate this
with static data and make inferences over the lot.  Streams include sensor
data, as well as ever-flowing social media streams for example; anything that
changes over time.  
  
They've built some systems to process this kind of data, and one of them is
available as middleware.  
  
My [raw notes are here](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/07/notes-manfred-
hauswirth-at-sssw2013.html).  
  
In the afternoon we had a poster session, where all participants pinned up
posters about their work, and discussed at length with anyone who was
interested.  Here's evidence that I participated.

And here's Paolo's:

I wrote a few [notes](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/07/notes-poster-session-
at-sssw2013.html) about things from other peoples' posters that I need to look
up.  
  
The main feedback I received was about making sure I focus, narrow down my
topic, and concentrate on some evaluatable deliverables that are PhD-worthy.  
  
Questions like (paraphrasing) "why should we care about digital creatives?"
threw me, because I thought the obvious answer - that _they are people too_,
Web users, technology users, contributors to culture and an ecosystem of
digital content and data - was apparently not enough from an academic
standpoint.  
  
I was simultaneously told to focus more, and to explain why the problem I'm
trying to solve is applicable to all domains, not just digital creatives.  But
some of the problems I'm looking at have been (or are being) solved in other
domains (like e-health, biological research, education) and the reason what
I'm doing is interesting is because none of these solutions quite work for
digital creatives, and I want to find solutions that do, and try to figure out
why.  
  
I'm still stuck in some sort of struggle between theory and practice; thinking
and doing.  And the long-standing problem of how to decide which _doing_
actually worked.  
  
I've started scribbling notes about the narrowing down problem.  I'll need to
have this figured out before my first year review in August anyway, so stay
tuned for another post all about it.  
  
Then I sneaked off for a nap.  
  
Dinner at the bar again; the usual salad, plus some eggy fish thing for most.
I got a plate of artichoke.  Artichoke is great, I love it, and I'm all for
simple meals.  But I remain unconvinced that a plate of only artichoke
constitutes an acceptable level of effort on the part of caterers.  And the
sheer quantity made it start to taste a bit funny after a while.  But not to
worry; we rounded off with a solitary peach apiece.  
  
Further socialising, and appreciation of the night sky, before returning to
<strike>bed</strike> write blog posts.  
  
I'm super excited and inspired by the talks, work I've heard about so far, and
the atomsphere of the place.  I'm excited to learn a helluva lot, and remind
myself that I'm not facing impossible problems, and am not facing many
problems alone.  I remember that I am instinctively passionate about the Web
and the possibilities it holds (and indeed has already realised) for the
empowerment of individuals.  I remember how lucky I am to be able to sustain
myself through studying something I love so much, and to have the potential to
make a change, and through my work maybe even facilitate others to be able to
make a living doing what they love, as well.
