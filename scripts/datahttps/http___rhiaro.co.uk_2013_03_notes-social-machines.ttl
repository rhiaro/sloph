**J. Hendler, T. Berners-Lee, From the Semantic Web to social machines: A research challenge for AI on the World Wide Web, Artificial Intelligence (2009), doi:10.1016/j.artint.2009.11.010**

  

Powerful human interactions enabled by futuristic high-speed infrastructure.

Empower Web of people via coupling of AI, social computing and new
technologies.  "humanity in the loop".

Social machine: "...processes in which people do the creative work and the
machine does the administration." (Weaving the Web, p172).

Struggling with social mechanisms to control predatory behaviour and threats
to privacy.

-> Tech must be developed that allows user communities to construct / share / adapt social machines, so successful models evolve through trial, use and refinement.

Claims a new generation of Web Technologies needed to overcome barriers to
this; cross-disciplinary approach needed.

  * creating tools
  * creating principles and guidelines
  * extending Web infrastructure re: information sharing and address privacy and user expectations of data use.
  

"...a revolutionarily more powerful platform for the individual, enabled by
realizing that the individual is also a member of a community" (/ies)

"architecture of the future Web must be designed to allow the virtually
unlimited interaction of the Web of people" (vs. documents now)

"disruptive potential" of SWt, "important paradigm shift"

"little work in understanding the impact of their new capability"

"the smaller we can make the individual steps of this transformation, the
easier it will be to find humans who can be incentivized to perform those
steps."

"need to develop mechanisms to enable [connections between people]"

  

Lack structure for formally computing qualities like:

  * trustworthiness
  * reliability
  * expectations about use of information
  * privacy
  * copyright
  * (etc)
  

"requires data structures... to treat social expectations and legal rules as
first-class objects" ("declarative rule-based infrastructure that is
appropriate for the Web").

  

"open and distributed nature of the Web requires that rule sets be linked
together."Cross-context use, sometimes unanticipated.Inconsistency sure to
arise.  No logics that control contradiction have been shown to scale well.

New approaches to problem of specifying contexts (need).

SMs must be able to apply different policies based on context.

Work in ontologies must extend to allow user communities to identify bias and
share different interpretations.

  
Current security models / mechanisms insufficient.

which uses of data are policy-compliant.-> How to tackle scaling?
