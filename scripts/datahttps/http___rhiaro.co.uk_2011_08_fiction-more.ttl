  as:content """I wrote two stories today! Without even the random words. I'm on fire. One was
inspired by old people at the bus stop (maybe getting out of the house
helped?) and I titled it _An Inconvenient Youth_. I'm still in debates with
myself about this. The second was a ten minute jobby that I started two
paragraphs before I finished the _first_ (indeed, on the same document) and I
called _Whut is Lurve Anyhaw?_. It similarly takes place on a bus, but is a
primarily a monologue in what I hope is a southern US accent.  
  
Both of these stories are currently on an adventure along with the
conspicuously absent Ethel and Jake, which should take no longer than two
months or so to complete. Depending on the outcome of the adventure, they may
arrive here.
