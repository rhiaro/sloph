the success of social media use in business.  The SIOC ontology is widely used
to describe online community information.  It's not as simple as measuring
someone's engagement with a brand's online presence - people are 'likeaholics'
on Facebook, so you have to look at someone's whole behaviour profile to judge
whether their like means anything or not.  It's no good just aggregating your
data and spewing out numbers - you have to _browse_ the data and try to
understand where it came from.  
  
He mentioned how little work has been done in classifying community types.
Most of the work that has been done seems to be with social networks internal
to an organisation.  A bottom-up approach to community analysis can handle
emergent behaviours and cope with role changes over time.  Looking at
behaviour categories and roles can help an organisation to decide who to
concentrate on supporting and how in order to sustain the community.  The
results they have seen so far suggest that a stable mix of the different types
of behaviours are needed to increase activities in forums - but they don't
know what causes what.  They're reaching a point where they can use their
behaviour analysis to guess what's going to happen to a community: how long it
will last, how fast it will grow, how many replies a certain type of post is
likely to get, etc.  
  
Next they want to be able to classify community types, and be able to look at
activities within a community over a period of time and automatically discover
what kind of community it is; it might be something different than what it was
set up for.  
  
They created an alternative Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to correspond with
activities seen on forums, and found that most people are happy to stay at the
lower levels of the hierarchy.  For example, join a community, lurk for a bit,
ask one question and leave.  Not everyone wants or needs to be a power user.  
  
Papers are being written that find patterns in individual datasets for a
particular community in a particular context.  Harith and his team are getting
tired of this; they want to generalise across communities.  So they took seven
datasets and looked at how the analysis features differed as well as comparing
the results across community types, randomness (vs. topicality) of datasets,
and compared similar experiments.  
  
Upcoming work includes the _Reel Lives_ project, in which UoE is involved.
They're taking media fragments - photos, videos, audio clips, text recorded as
audio - and creating automated compilations to tell a story.  
  
Another is social methods to change energy consumption behaviour.  LiSC in
Lincoln did something in this area back in the day.. [an app that posted that
you were listening to an embarrassing song on your facebook feed if you left
your lights on](http://lisc.lincoln.ac.uk/research-areas-2/sustainability
/power-ballads/).

** [SSSW 2013 - Feeding Recommender Systems with Linked Open Data](http://www.slideshare.net/tommasodinoia/sssw-2013-feeding-recommender-systems-with-linked-open-data) ** from **[Tommaso Di Noia](http://www.slideshare.net/tommasodinoia)**

  
From Tommaso Di Noia's talk, I learnt that recommender systems have a lot of
maths behind them, especially for evaluating things, and reinforced something
I already knew: I don't maths good enough to be taken seriously by most of the
Informatics world.  I think I understand the principles behind the maths, but
when something is descried in just maths, I have no idea what it relates to.
I'll work on this.  
  
Real world recommender systems use a variety of approaches, including
collaborative (based on similar users' profiles); knowledge-based (domain
knowledge, no user history); item-based (similarities between items); content-
based (combination of item descriptions and profile of user interests).
Linked Open Data is used to mitigate a lack of information about entities, and
helps with recommending across multiple domains.  You do have to filter the LD
you use before feeding it to your recommender system though, to avoid noise.
[Notes here](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/07/notes-tommaso-di-noia-at-
sssw2013.html).  
  
Tommaso's talk was followed up by a [hands-on
session](http://sssw.org/13-ho/ho3/), where we got to poke about with some of
the tools he mentioned, including [FRED](http://wit.istc.cnr.it:9191/fred)
(transforms natural language to RDF/OWL); [Tipalo](http://wit.istc.cnr.it
/stlab-tools/tipalo/) (gets entity types from natural language text); and
using DBpedia to feed a recommender system.  
  
Then we worked on our mini-projects for the afternoon.  We made some progress
towards breaking down the concept of serendipity and working out what
properties we might need to represent as linked data, and how we could
observer a user and work out if/when/how they were having serendipitous
experiences without intruding too much.  
  
In the evening we took a coach to 'nearby' historical town Segovia.
Apparently an extremely motion-sickness-inducing two and a half hour coach
journey around twisty mountain paths is 'nearby'.  Fortunately I was
distracted from this horrible journey by a conversation with Lynda Hardman,
which I wish I had recorded.  Lynda challenged various aspects of my PhD until
I could explain/justify them reasonably, including:  
  

  * Why digital creatives? (I'm used to that one now).
  * What is the outcome?
  * Why Semantic Web for this?
  
She also recommended a number of resources, including theses of her recent
former students to help me with a structure for my own, and advice on
maintaining a healthy balance between thinking and doing.  
  
Plus she used to live in Edinburgh, more or less across the road from where I
live now.  Cool.  Thanks Lynda!  You haven't heard the last of me :)  
  
**#travel**  
  
Once we got to Segovia, we had a guided tour of the ancient Roman
architecture, interesting building faÃ§ades and local legends.  It was a very
good tour, but too hot to really focus.  Then they took us to a restaurant for
a local speciality.  I was all set to write a whole individual blog post
surveying the barbaric nature of human beings, but I didn't do it straight
away and now the passion has faded slightly, so I'll leave it at a paragraph.
Some people watched the local 'ceremony' out of morbid curiosity I imagine,
but it was the fact that so many people took so much _pleasure_ in the idea of
violently hacking up bodies of three-week-old piglets that really bothered me.
Fortunately the surging standing crowd allowed me (and only one other) to
inconspicuously sit it out.  The veggie option was tasty, but it was difficult
to really enjoy the rest of the evening whilst wondering vaguely about the
states of minds of most of the people I was sharing a table with.
