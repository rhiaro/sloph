Created a location-constrained community noticeboard as part of a hyperlocal digital newspaper (via a Wordpress plugin). The cool part is, you read and write to the noticeboard through scanning a QR code that's on a giant wooden [totem pole](http://www.communityhacking.org/category/totem-pole/) in the middle of a field. I can't take responsibility for the totem pole.""" ;
