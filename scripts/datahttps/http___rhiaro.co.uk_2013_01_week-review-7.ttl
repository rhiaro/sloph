**  
**Mostly things not strictly PhD related...  
**  
**18th - Initial meeting about organising a hack for undergraduates during Innovative Learning Week in February  
19th - Discussed how local small scale community groups can benefit from Open
Data, and how they could get involved in the ILW hack, with Freda O'Bryne and
Euan Jackson.  
        \\\\\\\\- Also discussed these things with Ewan, and started on a spreadsheet of decent apps that use Open Data, and links to their data sources.
