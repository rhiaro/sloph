  as:content """Change of plan.  Trying to run the whole thing with Blogger templates did not
result in a happy time.  So the main site pulls and manipulates the Blogger
RSS feed, with [Simple Pie](http://simplepie.org/) making that easy.  
  
I then simplified the actual Blogger template and made it match and stuff.
The general intention now is that individual posts and comments will be
viewed, if necessary, via Blogger, in a kind of archive-y way, but the content
organised as I see fit exists on the main site as the primary port of call.  
  
But _my goodness_ does Blogger automatically add some crap into its templates.
I delete stuff and it comes right back.  Pointless classes, and divs, and
general unnecessary bulky markup.  I give up with trying to strip all that
out.  
  
By the way, [the source code for the site is
here](https://bitbucket.org/rhiaro/rhiaroco).  Share and share alike, yada.
