[Words were generated randomly. I swear I didn't expect them to be this
topical.]  
  
Little Steve poked at the pile of circuitry in front of him with a screwdriver
the length of his forearm. His nose wrinkled with concentration as he
carefully extracted a string of spaghetti. His father would not be pleased.  
  
As usual, the aliens had come whilst his parents were sleeping. Last time it
had only been the TV remote that they'd abducted. The time before that it was
a standing lamp. This time, it was his father's brand new Macintosh computer.
Steve did not want to be around for his dad's reaction, but being four-years-
and-seven-months old, he struggled to find excuses to be absent from the
house. So he would have to face the consequences.  
  
They always blamed him of course; not when things went missing, but when they
came back. Because most of the time, things came back having been partially
transformed into something tasty. The lamp had been embedded with chocolate
chips. The insides of the remote, filled with ice cream. They never believed
him when he explained about the aliens and their faulty teleporter. His mother
just eyed him with suspicious terror, and his father talked in a stern voice
about respecting peoples' things, and the cost of psychological counselling.  
  
Steve reached for tweezers in an attempt to extract flecks of bolognese. The
machine had been quite literally turned inside out before being dosed with a
hearty Italian meal. It may well be beyond salvation.  
  
He sighed, rolling his eyes at the spot in the night sky in which he knew
their mothership resided. If their pattern of taking increasingly
sophisticated devices was to continue, something must be done.  
  
Steve crept through the dark house and reached a tiny hand onto the desk in
the study. The hand withdrew with his father's billfold clutched firmly
inside. He extracted all of the notes, and returned the wallet to its previous
position. Tiptoeing through the kitchen, tiles chilling his bare feet, Steve
tucked the money between his lips and shrunk to all fours to squeeze through
the dog-flap in the back door.  
  
The plantpot where he made his offerings was beside the door; Steve squashed
the cash into the mud, making sure it was covered, then popped a marble on top
so they'd know.  
  
"_Fix your teleporter_," he hissed into the darkness.  
  
Steve returned to bed, hoping sincerely that the aliens would deal with their
technical problems before it was his turn.
