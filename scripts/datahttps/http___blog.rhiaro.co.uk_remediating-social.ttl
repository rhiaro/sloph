<http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/remediating-social> as:content """I spent the last few days in Edinburgh College of Art, helping out at the
[Remediating the Social](http://elmcip.net/confernece) conference.  I was in
charge of making sure everyone's microphones were on, and slides were being
projected, which turned out to be more work than anyone anticipated.  Only
minor hiccups occurred though, usually when I unplugged something I shouldn't
have by accident.  I couldn't have done it without my glamourous assistant
JosÃ©, who was the master of fiddling with Macbook screen resolutions to make
them play nice with the projector.  
  
More importantly, I saw some super interesting talks, and met and talked to
[some](http://www.motorhueso.net/) [fantastic](http://nickm.com/)
[smart](http://jilltxt.net/) [people](http://www.simanowski.info/) about
electronic literature, and other things.  
  
I also presented about [Palimpsest](http://literarycities.org/), in front of
the biggest audience I have ever talked in front of.  Go me.  
  
Videos of everything from the conference are
[here](http://bambuser.com/channel/ELMCIP).  
  
On the last day I implemented an idea that had been kicking around the back of
my mind for a while, which was the Uninformative Twitter Wall, or [Twitter
Squares](https://rhiaro.co.uk/twittersquares).  It's nothing particularly
complex; it uses jQuery and probably has memory leaks.  I'd love for people to
help themselves to the code and improve it. Converting a hash of a tweet text
into a hex code, I generated coloured squares for the results of a search
term.  If the feed you choose is updating a lot, then the squares move around
quickly and it looks pretty funky.  If there are only occasional new tweets,
then it looks less exciting, but is still equally useless for seeing what
people are saying.  (Unless you hover over the squares).  That's okay though,
because it's Art.
