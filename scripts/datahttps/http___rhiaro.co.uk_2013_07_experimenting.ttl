  as:content """I have been on no fewer than thirteen planes in the last four weeks or so.
I've already made my apologies to the environment.  If it's any consolation,
it makes my ears really hurt every time.  It's only four days, after that,
until I get on a flight from Edinburgh to Madrid.  It's becoming as normal as
going for a walk.  (A walk with earache and slight deafness).  
  
Presumably, if using electronic equipment during takeoff and landing, and
mobile phones at any time, was actually dangerous there would be some sort of
machine to detect if any passengers did have things turned on, and electric
shock them (or something).  And there would be a degree of consistency in how
these things were handled between airports.  In quite a few airports in
Australia, we were asked to turn our phones off altogether before stepping
onto the tarmac to approach the plane.  I saw a couple of people who were
walking and tapping their screens get pulled aside and refused boarding until
their devices were safely off and pocketed.  No planes were crashing in the
background.  And nobody checked that out-of-sight gadgets were switched off.
So you only pose a risk if you get caught?  And in Zurich, the crew were happy
with people making phonecalls right up until the plane started trundling.  
  
Security is inconsistent too.  And a massive hassle, so in an endeavour to
minimise unpacking and re-packing time at the gates, I gradually reduced the
number of electronics and liquids I removed from my hand luggage.  
  
A timid and inexperienced flyer before this year, I used to think it was
standard procedure to remove everything with a glimmer of metal or a drop of
liquid for an x-ray in its own separate tray.  So out came the chargers,
headphones, coins, cards and soaps, along with tablets, e-readers, laptop,
phone and clear bags of 100ml containers of liquids.  
  
Before the start of this trip I'd figured out that was excessive, and silently
pitied those who unloaded all of these things still.  
  
Time to see what else the security guys don't give two shits about.  
  
Kindle.  That was fine.  Nobody questioned a Kindle left in my bag.  
  
Tablet was the next to stay.  My Nexus 7 caused zero concern.  
  
At this point I'm just unloading a laptop and liquids.  
  
So I left the toothpaste in.  That was fine.  Then I found out one of my
travel buddies had been inadvertently passing through security gates with a
250ml bottle of suncream in the side pocket of his rucksack.  Apparently not
an issue.  
  
At some point on the trip I acquired small scissors; so weak they could barely
cut thread.  They made it through security in Sydney the first time just fine,
but in Alice Springs my bag got pulled back.  I thought it was the toothpaste,
but no.  Once they had confirmed that these scissors were such that they'd
buckle before piercing skin, they let me have them back.  Same again in
Cairns, and Gold Coast.  By Sydney round three, the scissors had broken into
two parts.  A very concerned looking lady asked if she minded if she threw
them away rather than let them on the plane.  I didn't.  
  
By this point I was sending 50ml nasal spray and deodorant through, because
what the heck?  They were also cool with our massive jar of pasta sauce, and
whatever we happened to be drinking at the time.  
  
So within Australia, I was just removing my laptop at security (and phone from
my pocket).  
  
In Singapore, signs actually advised that we keep phones, tablets and
e-readers packed, so only the laptop came out there too (my liquids were in my
hold baggage by this point).  
  
Zurich, however, are nuts.  
  
No liquids still, and I got out my Nexus and Kindle straight away because
someone ahead of me was getting yelled at about an iPad.  
  
Apparently that wasn't enough, and eager staff sent my bag back through three
times, unloading more on each round.  Out came chargers, headphones, bags
within bags, chocolate.  I was almost ashamed of how much crap I was carting
around.  For the final round they dug deep to extract a a sealed bar of soap I
bought someone as a souvenir from Cairns.  That seemed to do the trick.  
  
So then I had to hold up the line re-packing.  
  
How does x-raying soap on its own make it less of a threat?  Or easier to
detect the threat?  Serious question.  Anyone know?  
  
I'm just pleased I left my Vegemite and teas in my hold luggage.
