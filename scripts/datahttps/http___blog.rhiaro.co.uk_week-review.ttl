**  
**I read two papers about ontology development methodologies.  
  

  * [Notes are here](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2012/11/phd-notes-about-ontology-creation.html).

I read [two](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/12/09/06/1428210/bring-on-the-
decentralized-social-networking)
[articles](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/12/10/05/1215249/decentralized-
social-networking-why-it-could-work) by Bennett Haselton about decentralized
social networking, which happened to pretty much sum up and beautifully
articulate everything about that that has been floating in my subconscious for
a couple of weeks.  I saw links to them in the latest
[Circumventor](http://peacefire.org/) email, which I've been subscribed to
since High School for bypassing the internal blacklist, and remain subscribed
to because the jokes at the end are _always_ laugh-out-loud funny.

  

  
I attended an all day course entitled 'practical project management for
research students'.  
  

  * It was attended by a diverse bunch of seemingly really lovely people.
  * The two ladies running it, from the IT Project Management department in the University, were lovely too.
  * The stuff covered was all obvious, common sense stuff (and pleasantly the organisers didn't try to claim otherwise) - but sometimes it's helpful to have it all written down and waved in your face.  And _structured_, in particular.  Made me actually focus on thinking about organising my project.  The main thing I hadn't much considered, even subconsciously, was formally identifying stakeholders for a project and their relative interest/power in the project.
  * There are a bunch of tools at projects.ed.ac.uk to aid in project management.
  * It prompted me to do these week-in-review posts, as I realised I haven't been recording properly everything I've been doing (an overview of my time goes on my calendar, but no detail).
  * The sandwiches weren't great, but fortunately when I got back to the Forum there were massive slabs of chocolate cake left over from some event.  I love the Forum.

I booked a place at the [1st International Open Data Dialogue](http://open-
data.fokus.fraunhofer.de/?page_id=12&lang=en) in Berlin, and necessary
flights.

  * Despite the short notice, it worked out logistically because I need to be in London on the 7th anyway, so I can simply go to London on the 4th, fly to Berlin from there for the 5th and 6th, and back to London for the 7th.
  * I'm particularly looking forward to "Open Statecraft: Openness as a Means (not an End)" by Philipp MÃ¼ller, "The Open Data Movement vs. Business Models - is this a Contradiction?" by Dr. Peter A. Hecker, "Linked Open Data @ W3C-Vocabularies, Working Groups, Usage Scenarios" by Prof. Felix Sasaki, "The potential of Open Data for improving urban sustainability" by Dr. Marianne Linde and "Towards Trustworthiness: Establishing Transparency with Open Information Flows" by Dr. Edzard HÃ¶fig.
  * I'm also looking forward being in Berlin again, even if it is just for one evening, and I'll probably be too exhausted to appreciate it.

Ontologies with a View took place at a different place and time to usual.

  * [And with added pancakes](http://ontologieswithaview.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/week-3-ontologies-with-breakfast.html).

I started preparing for presenting at [Digital Methods as a Mainstream
Methodology](http://digitalmethodsnmi.com/events/event-2/) in London in a
couple of weeks.

  * I scribbled lots of notes.
  * I skimmed a few papers by organisers/speakers but didn't read any in detail yet.  Mostly stuff about analysing data gathered from comments, tweets etc. 
  * There will be more about both of those things next week, I imagine.

I made a plan for the two weeks following the 20th.

  * It mostly consists of finishing my Digital Methods preparation.  I have a lot of non-PhD related things to do as well, plus lots of travelling.  Also graduation from my MSc, and subsequent parental visitation will get in the way.
