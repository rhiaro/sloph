## Edinburgh Freegle

[Freegle](http://ilovefreegle.org) is a national network for promoting reuse and reducing waste by enabling people to give away stuff they don't need anymore, and other people to pick second-hand things for free, in their local area. I'm a sub-par mailing list moderator, and I feel bad about being so inattentive.""" ;
