  blog:tmpcontent """First ever non-stop lap of Holyrood Park this evening, hills and all. Just over 7km in total as I went office to home, so not quite the whole way. But I've never managed that before, I usually have to walk the hilliest parts. Running the whole way was something I was expecting to work up to over several months or a year. And I haven't even had a regular running schedule recently. And I didn't even really feel it; the last stretch was like flying. So, achievement unlocked.
