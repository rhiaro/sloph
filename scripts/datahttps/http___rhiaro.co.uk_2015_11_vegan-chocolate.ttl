  blog:tmpcontent """# Vegan chocolate fudge pie

I adapted [Chocolate Covered Katie's chocolate fudge pie recipe](http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2011/09/06/the-ultimate-chocolate-fudge-pie/) - not much, and only in the sense that I couldn't measure everything properly and she leaves several ingredients to the baker's discretion.

Crust: whole wheat flour, coconut sugar, vegetable oil.

Filling: tofu (less than the recipe), melted coconut oil + cocoa (melted chocolate substitute), more cocoa, coconut sugar, coconut milk, drizzle of maple syrup. (Omitted salt and vanilla).

As promised on Katie's blog... really good. It set perfectly after about half an hour in the fridge. And before it set, it worked great as mousse.
