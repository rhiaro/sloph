  as:content """A quick explanation in advance of future posts.  
  
The concept of forced fiction is well known and popular, but I've never heard
it called that before.  I think it's an appropriate name.  Normally I write
because I have an idea.  When I don't have many ideas, or I'm preoccupied with
other things, I go for enormous stretches of time without a word of fiction
leaving my pen.  Recent events have made me realise that there exists an
upward spiral; writing often both improves the quality of prose, and the
frequency of ideas generated.  But ideas from nowhere are a blessing, and not
to be taken for granted.  
  
Thus, forced fiction.  A minimum of every two days, if I haven't written
anything idea-based, I will generate five random words using [this](http://wat
chout4snakes.com/creativitytools/RandomWord/RandomWordPlus.aspx), for example,
and not move until I've written a piece of flash (or longer, if the mood takes
me) containing them all.  
  
And in a crazy and unforeseen turn of events, I'm going to post them on here.
Unless I _really_ like them, then I'm going to keep them to myself.  
  
So now you know.
