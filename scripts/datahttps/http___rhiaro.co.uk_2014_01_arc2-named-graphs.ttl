# ARC2 Named Graphs

Dimly aware that ARC2's triplestore uses named graphs, I decided to check where all my triples are at the moment. Turns out any inserted from php scripts are inside a graph whose URI is the file path to the script, eg. `<http://localhost/testclasses.php>`.

Maybe I should think about more proactively sorting my graphs.""" ;
