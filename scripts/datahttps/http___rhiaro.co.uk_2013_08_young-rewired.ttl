  as:content """Young Rewired State is a week-long hack event for under 19s.  There are
centres all over the UK, and the week finishes with a giant sleepover in the
Custard Factory in Birmingham, presentations and prizes.  
  
I was helping out with running the Edinburgh centre this year, between the 5th
and 11th of August.  We had 15 young people taking part, and a few parents
popping in and out as well.  Not to mention several fantastic mentors.  
  
Every day we gathered in one of the University of Edinburgh Informatics
computer labs.  On the first day we did some brainstorming, introduced the
young people to Open Data, and they sorted themselves into teams.  
  
We had a diverse range of projects by the end of the week.  
  
The _Weatherproof_ app was written in Scala with a Web frontend, and as well
as telling you the weather forecast, gives you practical advice on what to
wear and what to take with you.  
  
_Stuff Index _was a Python Web app that lets people photograph and upload
stuff they've left out on the street that they want to get rid of, so anyone
browsing the site can opt to take it away if they fancy it.  Helping to keep
stuff out of landfill, and without the dreaded social interactions that come
with Freegle.  
  
_Tag_ is a game by a one-man team, with a Python game server and a JavaScript
front end that lets you chase your friends around the real world, and
automatically tags them when you're in range.  
  
_PokeGame _is a real-world Pokemon simulator that lets you roam IRL and
capture virtual Pokemon.  
  
Great stuff!  
  
On Friday we crammed into a coach along with the participants from Aberdeen,
Dundee and Glasgow, and set off on a seven hour road trip to Birmingham for
the finale.  
  
The Edinburgh teams didn't win anything, but the presentations were fantastic
and everyone had an amazing time.  The young people made new friends, learnt
tons of new stuff, and hopefully remain enthused about coding.  
  
Next year we're going to do more to walk through the creation process of some
example apps to get them started off, and maybe do a better job of introducing
Open Data and the possibilities it holds.  
  
We're also thinking about starting a regular under 19s code club in Edinburgh
- weekly or bi-weekly - so stay tuned for more info about that.  (And if you
want to help or participate, get in touch!)
