  as:content """I haven't blogged about yoga yet, but now seems like as good a time as any to
start.  
  
I started yoga-ing towards the end of 2012, with on-and-off classes at the
Commonwealth Pool, then joined two beginner classes (with very different
teaching styles) in January that ran for a semester as part of Edinburgh
Council's [Adult Education Programme](http://ces.egfl.net/programme/).  I was
hooked, and since the start of this semester I've been doing four classes a
week:  
  
Monday is Vinyasa 'power' yoga, one of the classes held by the [University's
Yoga Society](http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/society/EUYS/).  It's fast,
sweaty and intense, and I'd never have been able to handle it - or enjoy it -
as a complete beginner.  
  
Tuesday is a really relaxed beginner class running this term through the
University Chaplaincy, mainly for relaxation. Great for the final hour of the
24 hour recovery from Monday's class.  
  
Wednesday and Thursday are post-beginner Adult Education Programme classes, in
Cameron House Centre and Nelson Hall respectively, with one of the teachers
from my first semester of regular classes before the summer.  
  
But what I _really_ wanted to say, is that today I got myself into a full
backbend unassisted (the last two weeks I've had help) and got substantially
closer to reaching my toes with a straight back than I ever have before.  
  
Go me.  
  
(I definitely have shorter hamstrings than is normal, and my main aim with
yoga is improving on that).
