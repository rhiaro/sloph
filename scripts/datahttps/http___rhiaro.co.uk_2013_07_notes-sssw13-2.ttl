** [Introduction to Linked Data](http://www.slideshare.net/mdaquin/sssw13-ldtut) ** from **[Mathieu d'Aquin](http://www.slideshare.net/mdaquin)**

  
Linked Data = _universal_ connections, like Lego.  
  
Universal is why it's important.  
  
[Workshop instructions](http://sssw.org/13-ho/ho1/).  
  
The only problem we had during the workshop was disagreement about how to read
the 'broader' and 'narrower' relations between courses.  It instinctively
ready contrary to what (my) common sense suggested (eg. that 'arts and
humanities' is broader than 'history', which some people disagreed with).  A
quick reference to the ontology documentation resolved that.
