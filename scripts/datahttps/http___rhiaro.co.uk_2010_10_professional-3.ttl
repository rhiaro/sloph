**  
**  
**Speaker:** Paul Charman  
**Area:** CV Writing   
  
I've had so many patronising talks about CV writing in my life that I'll admit
I was dreading yet another. The fact that Paul almost at once acknowledged
that his slides and advice may be patronising was a good start though, I
suppose. I have no doubt that for people who have _not_ been subjected to so
much identical advice in their lifetime would have found the talk useful and
informative, but for me it served only to reinforce everything I already knew.  
  
(Not to mention contradict some of the things the first speaker of this module
said, and consequently support some of my comments in my first blog post).  
  
With every website, book, tutor and professional giving out matching advice
about CV writing, it baffles me how people still manage to get it wrong. But I
guess advice is rarely given out for people to take. I do feel I learnt a
great deal about the subject over summer, working closely with the staffing
team at Google (although there are many company-specific quirks, that may not
apply to the wider industry). But if I want fresh, new advice about applying
for jobs, I feel I would seek it from a recruiter, someone in the industry...
someone who actually reads and judges the CVs for a living. But even then,
until recruitment processes in general get a massive overhaul, there is only
so much anyone can say about the subject.
