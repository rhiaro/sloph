[Nanowrimo](http://nanowrimo.org/).  
  
Last year, my MSc got violently in the way and I clocked out at about 15,000
words.  I'm hoping that this year, my PhD will make friends with my month of
literary abandon, and both will come out better for it.  
  
I stumbled into a new world last May, wandered around and met some characters
over the summer, and have been mulling over them ever since.  I put pen to
paper to draw a map today, and discovered that more of the world was there
than I thought.  
  
I have three viewpoint characters, and next I'm going to draw some squiggly
lines on a piece of paper to figure out where their paths cross, and what
might happen to them along the way.  Over the years I'm becoming more inclined
towards plotting in advance, but a large part of me never _really_ thinks
it'll help.  
  
I've been reading A Song of Ice and Fire, and am now gagging to create a world
with half as much depth and drama as GRRM has done.  Mine will be fantasy,
with a hint of sci-fi and a dash of Ancient Egypt (probably no medieval
knights).  
  
This year I'm going to work in
[yWriter](http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter.html) in an attempt to keep on top
of things as I expand settings and characters.  
  
I'm hoping to attend more than just the launch party for the [Edinburgh
Nanobeans](http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/regions/europe-scotland-
edinburgh#regions_forum) group this time round.  Though they do meet across
the wrong side of town, so I might also start my own write-ins (consisting of
just me) in Himalaya Cafe on South Clerk St. (it's ever so comfy, and the chai
is the best).  If you're writing too, and in that neck of the woods, come and
join me.  I'm tentatively saying I'll be there between 10 and 11am every day
(except Sunday, they're closed), starting on the 5th.  (This is going to cost
me a fortune in chai, isn't it..)  
  
Stay tuned for progress updates.  Or lackthereof.  
  
PS. I know I promised notes on papers related to my PhD... One day.  One day.
