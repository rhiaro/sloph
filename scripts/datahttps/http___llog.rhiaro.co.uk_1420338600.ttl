Alert enough on alarm to get up straight away. I usually fancy a coffee in the mornings, but haven't been at all; green tea instead. Feel like exercising again, so 45 minutes of yoga. Interesting, because I usually find it *so hard* to find time/motivation to do yoga at home (ie. not in a class).""" ;
