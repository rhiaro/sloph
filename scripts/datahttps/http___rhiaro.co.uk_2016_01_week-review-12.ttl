## 11-17 January 2016

A pretty *solid* week. Pun intended.

* Almost finished the resource browser for [dokieli](https://github.com/rhiaro/dokieli/tree/browser) and as a result started learning how to JS properly (Promises?!) and specifically interacting with Solid servers.
* General dokieli QA and [issues](https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli/issues) filing.
* Started outlining [LDOW dokieli paper](http://rawgit.com/csarven/dive-into-dokieli/master/index.html).
* Helped a little bit with materials for, and attended some of, Solid IAP hackathon/tutorials.""" .
