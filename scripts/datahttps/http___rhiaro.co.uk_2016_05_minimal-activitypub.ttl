  as:content """Today I finished [morph](https://apps.rhiaro.co.uk/morph), a client for posting ActivityStreams2 Update activities to an endpoint. The server handles this update activity however it wants, but the obvious thing to do is take the `object` of the activity and make the indicated changes.

So far it:

* Doesn't have proper authentication, just a field to enter in a key that the server uses to verify me.
* Doesn't do endpoint discovery, so I have to type that in as well.
* Only understands how to display ActivityStreams2 Collections, and only knows how to edit items within the Collections.
* Specifically only knows how to add `name`, `published` and `tags` to items in a Collection.

Will be expanding its object editing abilities soon.
