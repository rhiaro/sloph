  as:content """I've never sat up and counted down to the first of November before.  
  
In 2007 I used Nanowrimo as an opportunity to kick myself into writing some
more of a novel I started many years ago (reaching 35k new words by the end of
the month) and in 2008 I took part in earnest, came up with a totally fresh
idea the night before and hit the fifty thousand, two hundred and twenty ninth
word of Milo's World before midnight on the 30th. It was, quite simply, the
best feeling.  
  
In both 2009 and 2010, my degree objected strongly, and I didn't even try.  
  
This year, I know what being too busy to take part feels like, and I know what
missing out feels like. But I also know what taking part feels like, and I
know what winning feels like.  
  
This year, I'm writing an old idea in a new way. A short story from around
2007 sparked novel scribblings in 2009, which got left to fester. Looking at
these scribblings with eyes two years older, I plan to take the core concept
and solidify it into something readable.  
  
That's the theory, at least.  
  
I'm terribly excited about creating some new lives. Then destroying one of
those lives, and watching the effects cascade.  
  
I'm mostly nervous because I've never written anything set truly in this
universe before. Fifty percent of Milo's World was, and that fifty percent was
from the point of view of a child with an enormously vivid imagination, so
that doesn't really count.  
  
A good chunk of Currently Untitled will be set inside the main character's
head; a head which is subject to the physics and realities of this universe
regardless of how much her mind tries rebel against them.  
  
Her name is Harriet, by the way, and her little daughter is Rosy. I'll
probably tweet about them as real people, because for the next 30 days, they
might as well be. Rosy's dad is called Zeke, and Harriet's inconsequential
boyfriend's name is Paul, as far as I know. I'm also aware of the existence of
Patrice, a panda with an eye patch, and Arthur, a tiny penguin.  
  
I'll probably post some extracts here. But I can't post daily progress,
because of various linearity issues that I may or may not elaborate on in
time.  
  
But now, I'm going to stare at the counter on the front page of the Nanowrimo
site, and try to figure out that first line...
