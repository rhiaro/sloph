[Check out a bit of discussion about this paper on Ontologies with a
View](http://ontologieswithaview.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/week-6-annotating-
multimedia.html).  
  
OntoMedia for representing "diverse range of media".  
  
Others for media:  
  

  * CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (museums)
  * ABC Ontology (multimedia in libraries and digital archives)
  * Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (attribute and relationshops for task performed when consulting bibliographic records)
  * FictionFinder - FRBR to Online Computer Library Centre
  * WorldCat db - Metadata about characters and fictional places
    * Describe contents of films & comics etc for tracking things down to share you forgot?
  
None quite did what was needed.  
So created to map to current models but specifically describe media content.  
Hierarchical approach.  
  
1\\\\\\\\. Overview  
Entity / Event system  
Entity: object, concept  
Event: interaction between one or more entities  
0 or more Entities are modified OR new Entity created  
Entities not destroyed, but may have not-exists attribute  
  
  
Decompose to sub-ontologies.  
  
ontomedia.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ontologies  
  
Mediate? Graphical interface.
interaction.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ir/projects/ontomedia/ontomedia  
  
Sub-ontologies  
  

  * Core
    * Expression (primarily elements and subclasses; Entity, Event)
    * Media (binding between media and Expression objects)
    * Space (extension of Signage Location Ontology, buildings, and regions of structures)
  * Extensions (more detailed subclasses to Core)
    * Being (people)
    * Trait (attributes of Entities)
  * Events (extends Core->Event)
    * Action
    * Gain
    * Loss
    * Travel
    * & properties thereof
  * Fiction
    * Character (on Being)
    * spoiler info. and accuracy
  * Media
    * More detailed than the one in Core; includes audio, image, photo, text and video subclasses
  * Misc - classes used by any or all of other classes, eg. colour, geometry
  
Specified in OWL  
Developed in Protege and SWOOP.  
  
2\\\\\\\\. Case Study  
Scene from Total Recall annotated.  Represent script and characters, and
characters from related book, and links between two forms.  
  
Screenplay annotation - SiX - Screenplays in XML.  
Wraps around existing content.  
Transition (cuts, fades, blackouts), location, dialogue and direction (action
taking place in the script)  
  
SiX allows for DC, for creators, date, descr, title.  
Custom XSL to conform marked up scripts to Oscar requirements for readability.  
  
Script Item extends Media Item to link script representation to OntoMedia.  
Use has-expression to tie to OntoMedia:Expression.  
  
Describing places and access etc, like lift, like IF.  
\\\\\\\\- For describing character continuity, eg 'can character really see x' etc.  
  
Must describe events that don't occur.  Characters want to occur, etc.
Multiple timelines, dreams.  
  
Declare events.  
Create timeline and add occurances.  
\\\\\\\\- events can be reused, and coincide.  
  
3\\\\\\\\. Testing / querying  
Imported into Sesame triplestore.  
RDQL queries (subset of SPARQL, simpler, only ever has 1 graph pattern,
doesn't use RDF data typing)  
  
4\\\\\\\\. Conclusion  
No examples of pictures - how to annotate comics?  
  
Combining OM with other apps.  
Stuff integrated into Mediate.
