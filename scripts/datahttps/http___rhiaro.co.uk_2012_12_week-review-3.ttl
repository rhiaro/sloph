**  
**I went to the [1st International Open Data Dialogue](http://open-data.fokus.fraunhofer.de/?page_id=12&lang=en) ([#odd12](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23odd12)) in Berlin on Wednesday and Thursday, and gave a lightning talk at [Digital Methods as Mainstream Methodology](http://digitalmethodsnmi.com/events/event-2/) ([#dmmm2](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dmmm2)) in London on Friday.  
  
Both were brilliant; I met a ton of interesting people, learned loads and
gained much inspiration.  My extensive notes are in the process of being typed
up and thought about, and will be published on here as soon as humanly
possible!  
  
Now I'm going to catch up on sleep that crack-of-dawn flights and many hours
of train journeys have denied me recently.
