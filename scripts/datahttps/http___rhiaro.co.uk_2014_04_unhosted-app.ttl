# Unhosted App Ideas

If people release their models and data schema for remoteStorage apps, we can mash them up with much ease! I'm maintaining a list here of ideas that I may or may not get around to implementing:

* Notetaking app + bookmarking app = WebClipper functionality _and/or_ annotation of webpages
* Todo app + calendar app = duh.

Since most of the early Unhosted apps are life-organise-y ones, can we just have a dashboard that combines everything? Can we call it SORT YOUR LIFE OUT?""" ;
