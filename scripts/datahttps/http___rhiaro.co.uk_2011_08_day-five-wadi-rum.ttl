  as:content """The day started with a nice easy morning of packing and chilling out by the
pool. This was followed by an exhaustingly violent match of water polo, at
which Al and I were proven the indisputable champions. (We won nine-two
against H and Chris).  
  
We hit Wadi Moussa for a cheap (1JOD) and tasty falafel lunch. I have decided
that fresh lemon with mint is my drink of choice for the Middle East.  
  
A couple of hours drive took us to the Wadi Rum desert. The truck got slightly
stuck en route which is always exciting. Eventually we found a good spot and
pitched our tents. Al, H and I climbed to the highest rock we could physically
get to. It took a while. The view was awesome but getting bak down was a minor
disaster. Mostly for Heather. We made it eventually.  
  
After dinner and sunset we relaxed in the gradually cooling surroundings.
Speculation abot what was coming through the desert to get us definitely
didn't freak anyone out. Shortly after settling for the night, screams erupted
as Kath and Helen found a spider THIS big in their tent.  
  
I slept under the stars that night,and was still unaffected by this apparently
mythical 'cold' I have heard mentioned. I woke up with tiny little crabby
spiders everywhere, but with no additional bites. Which is always a sign of a
succesful camp.
