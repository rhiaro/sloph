# Lovelace Colloquium Edinburgh

I'm helping to organise the Lovelace Colloquium in Edinburgh this year! Lovelace is a one-day conference for female undergraduates studying technical subjects in the UK. There are talks, a poster competition, panel and social events. I've [previously talked about Lovelace here](#).

If you qualify, you should enter the poster competition. If you're a postgraduate or male in Edinburgh and want to help out instead, drop me an email!""" ;
