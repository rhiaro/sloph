  as:content """We had plenty of space on the train; big seats and air conditioning. I was
woken often by jolting starts and slamming doors, but all in all it wasn't too
bad.  
  
Carrying all of our stuff, we stumbled out of the station and onto a minibus
in Giza. Dave left us in the hands of a new guide, who was distinctly more
interested in getting us to the pyramids than letting us eat or use the loo.
We comprimised with pastries and juice from a fuel station shop and recovered
enough to be on our way.  
  
We wandered around the pyramids, and then the Sphinx. Underwhelming, all
things considered, and the Valley of the Kings is far more impressive. Also,
definitely aliens.  
  
Most people did the cheesy holding-the-pyramids photo thing. I took pictures
from the wrong angles of people posing these. This is far more entertaining.  
  
We had streetside falafel for lunch before visiting the enormous Egyptian
Museum. There's  
some cool stuff in here, again with the giant walls of heiroglyphics, and I
lost everyone  
else for a while.  
  
We were dropped at the Havannah Hotel. We thought there must be some mistake.
This place was SHINY. Huge rooms, clean, functioning bathroom facilities...
(for about Â£10pppn) A classy end to the trip. I passed out for a couple of
hours before we all met downstairs again at 6. The place Dave wanted to take
us for dinner was absolutely packed, but we were directed to another
restaurant a few doors down who promised to serve us food from the first
place. Interesting business technique, but it did the job. I had the
vegetarian version of f.... I can't remember what it was called but it
definitely began with f. Might have been fattah. Someone help me out please,
the Internet isn't doing yet. It was an extremely filling rice yogurty dish
with fried flat bread and peas in it. Suuuper tasty, and almost equal to
kushari. The non-vegetarian versions had liberal amounts of shredded beef or
chicken on top.  
  
After hanging out at the hotel for a bit, thus concluded the final night in
Egypt.
