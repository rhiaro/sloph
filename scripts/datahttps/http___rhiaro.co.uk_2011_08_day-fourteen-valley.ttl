  as:content """A 6am start for the Valley of the Kings, where a ticket allows entry to three
tombs. We saw those of Ramses third, fifth, and ninth. Pro tip: EVERYTHING is
half price with an international NUS card.  
  
The quality of the preserved colours and carvings in the tomb is stunning,
especially upon remembering that they are thousands of years old. Colours in
the tombs in the Valley of the Workers were even more intense - the workers
had one day off a month to work on their own family tombs, and put much more
effort into the art.  
  
After napping for a couple of hours we regrouped for lunch at a cafe in town.
My growing karkade addiction (did I mention this yet?) was satisfied and more
shopping commenced. We spent a while in a no-haggle statue shop and learnt how
to tell machine- or Chinese-made from handcrafted Egyptian wares, as well as
getting a demo on holding a naked flame to the black statues to prove they are
plastic and not the stone they are sold as on the street. We hung out in the
jewellers again, and were given more karkade. I then bought a ton of dried
hibiscus so I can make my own every day for the next year.  
  
Later that afternoon, H, Lizzie and I joined Dave on a visit to the SunShine
Orphanage, a charity sponsored by Oasis. Wewere covered in adorable drooling
toddlers for a couple of hours before our return.  
  
We all ate dinner at a restaurant overlooking the Nile. At the end of the
meal, an enormous chocolate cream birthday cake appeared bearing the message
'HAPPY BIRTDAY AMY' (sic). Thanks everyone! The best surprise. We ate about a
third of it then stored it in the hotel's freezer.  
  
To bed ready for an exciting 4am start...
