  blog:tmpcontent """# Shop assistant

## Bon MarchÃ©, Boston

My first 'real job'! Perpetually felt like a tent because they only sell plus-size clothes and we had to wear merchandise as our 'uniforms'. Traded favours with friends/my mum to come in and buy the shop magazine so I could meet weekly targets. The most fun thing to do was keep records of lowest-net-income days. The winner was a day when the only transaction I carried out was a refund.""" ;
