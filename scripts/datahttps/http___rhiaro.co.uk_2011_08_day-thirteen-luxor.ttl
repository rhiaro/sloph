  as:content """After our sandy night, we had another drive day. We were all pretty grimy. We
spent a majority of this journey learning interesting and enthralling 'facts'
from a quiz book we found on the truck. This consumed hours.  
  
We stopped for lunch and supplies at La Senza Mall; made up for some great
purchases at a super cheap Carrefour by spending the same amount on a single
coffee at an overpriced chain. Totally worth it.  
  
We arrived at Rezieky Camp in Luxor late afternoon. First things first, we all
upgraded to hotel rooms instead of the campsite. Secondly, we got in the
swimming pool. Slightly disturbing that we couldn't see deeper than a few
inches into the cloudy water, but we were all so filthy ourselves we were well
beyond caring. After showering and cleaning up properly, Dave took us into
town.  
  
Luxor may be the hassle capital of Egypt (reserving judgement on Cairo for
now). In a jewellers shop, the owner of which was known to the crew, we were
brought kushari and cold hibiscus (karkade). This may be my new favourite meal
in the world, and sparked the beginning of a slight addiction to karkade from
this point onwards. Unfortunately we were told that the ability to make
kushari well is a rare skill indeed. But I'm going to damn well try.  
  
Later we met our Luxor guide who took us that evening to Luxor temple. The
temple sits in the middle of the city, integrated with the local surroundings
like no other. A lot of Luxor is currently being demolished by the government
to make way for new excavations, as there is still apparently plenty left to
be found.  
  
Luxor temple at night was stunning, particularly due to the distinct lack of
other tourists in an area that we were told would usually be packed. Notably
we learnt about Hatshepsut, the only female Pharaoh, and why lots of her
likenesses have been erased in various temples. (Hint: her stepson hated her).  
  
Afterwards we walked back through the market and did some shopping. We got no
end of attention from sellers and locals alike. As we haggled here, we quietly
realised how royally ripped off we had all been in Dahab.
