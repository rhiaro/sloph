Research into SW communities:  
  

  * Communities of practice
  * Social networks, eg. FOAF
  
Compare with other definitions of communities outside of SW.  
_Concept_: Internet Based Community Network, has properties of COP and SN.  
_Case study_: Amateur Fiction Online.  
  
Early community definitions, Howard Rheingold: "..webs of personal
relationships in cyberspace."  
  
1996 CSCW Conference defined prototypical attributes of communities
(Whittacker):  
  

  * Shared goal / interest / need
  * Repeated active participation, emotional ties and shared activities.
  * Shared resources and access policies
  * Information, support and services reciprocated between members ( overlap with ^ ?)
  * Shared context (culture, language)
  * Can be applied to virtual and offline communities.
  
-> More attributes = clearer example of community.  
  
Preece:  
  

  * Social interaction
  * Shared purpose
  * Common set of expected behaviours
  * Computer system that facilitates and mediates communication
  
  
^^ Things in common.  Whittacker's is more inclusive/broad.  
  
So for a SW SN:  
  

  * Accessible via browser
  * Explicit links between users
  * System supports creation of these links
  * Links are visible and browseable
  
COP or SN may describe a community, not necessarily.  IBCN will do, and could
be a COP or SN too.  
  
Problem of Amateur Fic. is fluctuation of archive.  Personal sites go down
etc.  How to find a story you remember a bit of?  
  
IBCN is also combination of WBSN and virtual community.  
Lack of incentive to use FOAF (eg. on LiveJournal etc) (Plus ignorance).  
Doesn't offer anything they don't already have.  
They don't use much metadata, just tons of human-readable stuff.  
  
SW would allow:  
  

  * "better integration of distributed systems"
  * "improved searching and filtering"
  * "more personalised services"
    *   experienced users
      * expand options
      *   new ways to interact
    *  new users
      *   ease introduction re: unwritten rules, expectations, terminologies
  
  
FOP extension to FOAF for anonymous identities.  
('Fan Online Persona' - why not just 'Online Persona'?)  
Consistency likely in community-based system because of advantages of
reputation etc.  Identity cost.  
Shared set of behaviour values, or risk losing rep.  
Reputation gained by taking part.  (definitive part of community).  
Additionally by creating works.  
  
foaf:document and foaf:groups allow users to give details about their own
creations and review work of others.  
  
OntoMedia to describe content complements FOP.  
Options in FOP gathered from study of metadata of works in mailing lists,
websites and groups.  
Recommender system -> notification system.  
  
Allow SNS of writers to be studied at friend level and collaboration level.  
  
Application to allow users to create FOP under development...
