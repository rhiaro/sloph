  blog:tmpcontent """# Project ParrotDJ

## Undergraduate Research Opportunities Scheme grant, University of Lincoln

Set up an RFID sensor on the outside of a parrot cage, and some patterned, disc-shaped RFID tags inside, and a small Java programme to play a different genre of music depending on the tag placed by the sensor. And tried to train a parrot to use it. The first part worked pretty well, the last part not so much.""" ;
