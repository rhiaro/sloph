# Linked Data at the BBC

I've been offered a 3 month contact at the BBC, to work as a data architect on thier Linked Data Platform team in London! 

The BBC uses linked data to model all of the things of importance to their audience: people, places, events, news storylines, and general concepts which are used to group things together through tags. A lot of the power is internal only right now, used by journalists for categorising creative works, but more and more audience-facing parts of the website are powered by linked data.

I'm excited about seeing how linked data works in 'the real world' (as opposed to academia), and really interested to see how various semantic web theories translate in practice.""" ;
