# Prewired Maker Week

During the second week of the easter holidays, we hold Prewired every day! Also known as the Maker Week, from 12 til 4 dedicated mentors hang out in CodeBase and help the kids with projects. Some kids come for just a few days, and some for the whole week. They can work on whatever they like; some carry on with what they do at regular Prewired sessions, some start a new project that they aim to finish that week, and others choose to learn something totally new.

On the first day we had over 20 kids; on subsequent days it dropped down to 10-15 because lots of schools were starting back this week.

Here's a rundown:

* Marley worked on his Raspberry Pi and Arduino based robotic arm. I think he also did some general C++ and Python hacking.
* [Jonas](http://pages.prewired.org/jonas), [Joe]((http://pages.prewired.org/joe) and [Cerys](http://pages.prewired.org/cerys) launched their first ever websites (and learned how to use FTP in the process)!
* Toby and Sean built an model bus using Arduino and an ultrasound sensor, aimed at prevent low-bridge related accidents.
* Mark worked on his Android game in Unity. He also modded Prison Architect and put together a spreadsheet to manage people's Minecraft mods on his server.
* Malcolm worked on setting up and tinkering with his own Minecraft server.
* Dan, Robert and Bob worked together to create a suite of tools for teaching people HTML/CSS and Java, across a website and an Android app.
* Harry started learning Java with tutorials, and worked on improving one of his Scratch games.
* Connor and Oli played with the Twitter streaming API.
* Albie ported his iPad drawing app to Scratch, and made some Scratch animations.

Mega props to mentors for helping out over the course of the week: [Nantas](http://rad.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/nardelli), [Freda](https://twitter.com/fredaobyrne), Eder, [Luke](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/students/Luke_Shrimpton.html), Helen, [Cameron](http://camerongray.me) and [Rikki](http://rikkiguy.me.uk) (who came on his birthday!).
