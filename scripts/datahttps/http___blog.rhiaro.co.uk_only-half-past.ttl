[A summary of things I feel about HTML5, from a sleep-deprived mind]

  

It feels like it should be much later... earlier... than that.  Iâ€™ve spent
hours and hours reading debates about HTML5.  Mostly debates in the comments
of blog posts and articles.  I feel fairly well versed in two sides of the
argument, the nature of which boils down to â€œHTML5: What is the point?â€.  
  
My personal view is that progression is good.  Development for the sake of
development is good.  Even if you donâ€™t get it right the first time, at least
youâ€™re doing something, and not just whining about it.  Someone (yeah, someone
important, I donâ€™t do citations at this time in the morning) said that HTML5
was being developed for the present, and that it will be rewritten in the
future, to meet the needs in the future.  Lots of people had a problem with
that concept, as we should be developing for the future.  Lots of people
supported that concept, as predicting the future is quite a challenge.  I
havenâ€™t decided where I stand yet.  Maybe I donâ€™t need to.  
  
I like the fact things are changing, because it makes me feel excited and
challenged and all that.  It upsets me a little that Iâ€™d just got the hang of
all this web development malarky, and now thereâ€™s more?!  Lots of people seem
to feel the same about the latter.  Which is understandable.  Understandable
in a world where the web is expected to be a fixed thing, and you make a
website, and it works, and customers are happy, and clients are happy, and it
stays like that forever.  But the world and the web (and customers and
clients) are fluid and flowing and flexible and fickle.  Peoplesâ€™ needs
change, hardware changes, software changes, businesses change.  They always
have, and always will, so where this idea that the web should whoa slow down a
second and wait for the slower ones to catch up has come from, Iâ€™m not quite
sure.  
  
This makes it sound like HTML5 appeared overnight.  Which for me, in a way, it
did.  Appeared to my conscious, concentrating, information-absorbing mind,
anyway.  
  
But the part where the HTML5 spec has been under development for like six
years or something now?  Come on guys.  I know itâ€™s not easy, but really.
Give the lazy people something to complain about.  Or at least make a big deal
out of it from the start.  So â€˜theyâ€™ can start thinking about it from the get-
go.  Maybe a big deal was made, and I just missed it.  But I was making
websites six years ago, just.  So if I missed it, â€˜theyâ€™ did too.  
  
That last paragraph went a bit to the dogs.  What Iâ€™m trying to say is: the
little man on the ground, the guy making the websites day-to-day, the guy
dabbling, the guy fouling up the standard mark-up you hold so dear... Tell him
what youâ€™re doing, as youâ€™re doing it, so heâ€™s prepared.  
  
I know you canâ€™t force change.  Hell, outside of term time I still live under
a regime where IE6 is deemed a perfectly adequate browser, installing Chrome
â€˜breaksâ€™ IE, so isnâ€™t allowed, and [insert new web thing since 1997] might be
a great feature, but since my father doesnâ€™t explicitly use it, any
development on that front is pointless.  Hey, he even (almost daily) states
angrily that film making companies are at fault because their productions are
shown letterboxed on his 4:3 TV.  (I just searched so I could state that
widescreen TVs have been commonplace since [year], and discovered that films
have been being made in widescreen since around 1929.  HAH.  Iâ€™ll quote that
juicy fact next time).  But this is whole other blog post.  
  
I was going somewhere with this.  Oh yes.  
  
I still donâ€™t know whether I can put a <nav> in a <header>.  
  
Thatâ€™s all I was trying to find out when I stumbled across the various
debates.  
  
Iâ€™m officially declaring the HTML5 spec subject to interpretation.  
  
And Iâ€™m putting the <nav> in the <header>.  Itâ€™s part of the header of the
page.  In this particular context, if I had a div with id header, Iâ€™d put the
navigation inside it.  To hell with you all.  
  
PS. Thanks for the great work on developing HTML5, guys.  My life would be
dull and repetitive without the likes of you; Iâ€™d be reading and writing a lot
more fiction, and spending far more time with my family.  Much obliged.
