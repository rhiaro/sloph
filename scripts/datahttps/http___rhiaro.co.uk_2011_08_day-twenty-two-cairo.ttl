  as:content """We got up early on the final morning with the intention of cramming as much of
Cairo in before our flight as possible. No-one would take us to Tahrir Square,
and the Metro wasn't running. Taxis claimed to drop us off at the famous
market, but we struggled to find anything much... We wandered many
backstreets, and concluded that it was just early (for Ramadan) and everyone
was probably not quite up yet. Cairo streets are covered in gunk and litter
and smelly things, and they're tight and winding. I love them. The high walls
and narrow paths created an effect the closest to being hugged by a city I
have ever felt.  
  
We visited a couple of churches that we were ushered into by locals, before
stumbling across the Mohammed Ali Sibel and learnt about its history. We
climbed down a ten metre shaft too, and wandered around in the dark beneath
the building. It seemed like a good idea at the time.  
  
Heather and I had to head back for midday, and we enjoyed a whirlwind taxi
ride. Our driver stopped to ask directions from pizza delivery boys, other
taxis, policemen, passers by... We saw a huge amount of the city in the hour
it took us to find the hotel, with criss-crossing, elevated main roads
providing the perfect viewing platform.  
  
Cairo has perhaps the best cityscape I have ever seen. Sprawling and uneven
and _huge_. Bright colours, haphazard shapes, buildings that are jostling for
attention. Windows that churn out flapping bedsheets, streamers of electrical
wires; low roofs beside high walls, supporting slouching heaps of sand, bricks
and mud. The feeling that everything is always moving and the overriding
sensation that something is always happening in your peripherals.  
  
Needless to say, a half day was not enough. I will be back.  
  
Our predicted hour-and-a-half journey to the aiport took barely half an hour.
Free wifi at Cairo International could sure teach Heathrow a thing or two...
The airport was near enough a ghost town during the late afternoon. Staff were
laid back and friendly, and most of the queues we stood in were probably
unnecessary. I walked the wrong way down a conveyor. I had THE BEST TIME. One
lifetime ambition fulfilled.  
  
The flight, which left a bit after 5pm, was uneventful and we landed at 2125
in Heathrow, to 15 degrees, or what the pilot described as 'a standard British
summer evening'.  
  
I am counting down to my next adventure.  
  
It's not planned yet. Donations welcome. Watch this space.
