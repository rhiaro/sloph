  as:content """A mega early start to Dave's porridge, and the day was set in motion with a
drive to the ancient (once lost) city of Petra. Entrance was a steep 50JOD but
the stunning sights occupied us for about five to six hours.  
  
After entering through the gorge we walked along the cobbled pathway that lead
to the treasury. Being 7am, other tourists were scarce and we got some good
photos. We then began the inordinately long trek and climb in the increasing
heat to the monestary, admiring the homes, tombs and other structures carved
directly into the towering, naturally patterned red coloured rock faces.  
  
From the monestary we followed a trail to 'the end of the earth' where we sat
to take in a huge and humbling view whilst our friends back home were still
sleeping soundly. We got sidetracked on our return journey by the promise of a
spring in which we couls swim. We ventured well off the beaten track and
eventually found a trickle. We followed this a little way and enjoyed the cool
clear water (probably the same as we'd been drinking all day from bottles).
Some clambering and relaxing later we made our way back. Midday heat was
intensifying and the return to the town took its toll (on little old me at
least). We crashed in a pub for an hour or so to recouperate before catching a
taxi back to the hotel.  
  
JUMPED IN THE POOL.  
  
Dave invented killer frisbee which involved standing around the edges of the
pool and exchanging frisbee tosses, with the aim of catching them no matter
what. So lots of stylish (occasionally unnecessary) leaping into the water.  
  
We chilled out and redied ourselves for a buffet dinner at the hotel. I spent
the rest of the evening on the tenth floor roof of the hotel spying fireworks.
