Boy, this Week in Review thing really highlights when I haven't done a lot,
doesn't it?  I guess that's the point.  
  
I spent most of the week not getting round to writing up and analysing my
notes from the conferences.  
  
We had an [Ontologies with a View
meeting](http://ontologieswithaview.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/general-
discussions.html).  
  
I made a few connections and sent a few emails.  
  
I did lots and _lots_ of useful, but non-PhD-related things.  Honest.
