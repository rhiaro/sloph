  as:content """We spent a relaxing morning at the hotel before driving to Amman's City Mall
where we saw the Oasis truck for the first time. It's pretty damn awesome.  
  
City Mall is a large shopping complex and one of the most Westernised places
I've seen so far, for the most part with no dress code observed by either
locals or tourists. If you're in Amman and missing home, a taxi will take you
there from the centre for 3JOD. After enjoying their version of Subway, we hit
the massive Carrefour on the bottom level to buy supplies for the evening
meal.  
  
An hour drive from here took us to Madaba where we briefly visited a church
filled with intricate mosaics, the most promient being a map of the holy land.
We explored the small town and the guys hunted for beer (with success).  
  
Further driving through winding steep mountain roads eventually took us to our
campsite for the evening, on the side of Mt Nebo. We pitched our tents and
admired the incredible view over the Dead Sea and Israel. We watched the
sunset from this perspective too and Israel became an unearthly spectacle of
glittering lights. We saw plenty of shooting stars, and cooking duties were
gained and lost in wagers about the solar system (resolved by flaky 3G access
and texts home).  
  
Eventually we slept, woken periodically by the haunting call to prayer, all
the more beautiful for not being artificially amplified. A great introduction
forme into the world of bush camping.
