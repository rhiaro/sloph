  as:content """**8th - 14th April**  
**  
**Wednesday: returned from brief sojourn at my mum's; TechMeetup.  
Thursday: 2nd UK Ontology Networks Workshop (link to notes to follow).  
Friday: missed Social Computing seminar as (I found out later) they changed
rooms after I got there (8 minutes late, still not the latest).  
The rest: rewrote my literature review outline (still not happy, but need to
stop agonising over it as it still doesn't contain anything substantial).
Read a largely irrelevant paper about cultural computing (notes may or may not
follow).  Discovered [a book I
want](http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415782654/) and have asked
the University Library to get.  Only the first page of [the chapter I
want](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/47272/) is available to preview (I've made
enquiries to the author of the chapter, too).  Started reading [Socially
Mediated Publicness: An Introduction by danah
boyd](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08838151.2012.705200); notes
will follow.
