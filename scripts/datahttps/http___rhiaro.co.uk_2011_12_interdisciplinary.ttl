  as:content """**tl;dr** \\\\\\\\- My MSc group made an art installation. Me? Art? Shocking, right. I've formed some new ideas and opinions, and had lots of fun in the meantime. Photos coming soon.  
  

This semester I have been one fifth of the brains behind the ICP Group
Project. Our brief was essentially to make something between us by December.
There's quite a lot of scope there. The fact that we're working out of the
College of Art probably also leant a few assumptions to what the final outcome
should be.  
  

When we started this adventure, I was still coming to terms with the notion
that not everything needed a distinct _purpose_ to be a valid contribution to
society. What I mean is, whilst I understood the concept of art in principle,
I still couldn't quite align the idea of art for art's sake with my view of
the world. During the seminars, research and discussions of the past few
months, things like the value of play; the possibilities opened by beginning
research without a clear goal; the emergence of new ideas by unfocussed
exploration; have all started to round out an initially biased view of the
area in which I am now studying.  
  

Don't get me wrong. I'm still not going to look at an unadorned mirror on a
wall, labelled 'Untitled', and nod my head and make thoughtful noises about
the meaning of identity. Some 'art' is just plain silly.  
  

But I'm willing to take a little more time to think about the methods and
thought processes that went into creating something, and what might be the end
result in _addition_ to the physical outcome. It's likely that I'll still be
more of a fan of art that was created to raise awareness, to provoke thought,
or to explore innovative uses of new media or technology. But art that was
created 'just because' will get more of a chance in my books now than it might
have done three or four months ago.  
  

Being part of this kind of creative process no doubt influenced my altered
perspective. We started the semester as five strangers: Katherine, literature;
Tina, video editing and broadcast; Agnese, musical theory and graphic design;
Liz, sociology and prettyful artsy things; and myself, that new fangled
Interweb nonesense, and writing. We have grown into unit, mish-mashed our
skills, learnt a whole lot from each other, and been fed extensively by Liz.
It has been noted on a number of occasions how well we all gelled from the
start. Thus the 'group' part of the group project produced no problems at all.
That just leaves the 'project' part...  
  

So at the start, when notions of an 'installation' or 'performance' were
thrown around, I was almost horrified. The open nature of the project left us
so much scope, we could pool our skills to do something truly _useful_ or
revolutionary. I didn't want to just 'make art'. My head was still in the
computing world where the goal is always to make something that people will
use, or that will be informative, or influential; that will _reach people_.  
  

I wasn't completely close-minded, obviously. I went with the flow, as I am
wont to do. And in doing so, I learnt much.  
  

It was swiftly decided that 'memory' would be a suitable topic to explore for
the group project. We start taking photos of our group meetings in case we
could incorporate a super-meta aspect but we forgot quite quickly to keep this
up.  
  

Our goal became an installation, which was exhibited at [Inspace](http://maps.
google.co.uk/maps?um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=inspace+edinburgh&fb=1&gl=uk&hq=inspace&hnea
r=0x4887b800a5982623:0x64f2147b7ce71727,Edinburgh,+Midlothian&cid=0,0,47083585

BI) on the 13th of December. Photos coming soon! This consisted of four boxes,
metaphors for memory, and a wall hanging, each intended to explore a different
aspect of the elusive theme. We ended up with Woven Memories (Liz's beautiful
wall hanging), Spatial Memories (Katherine look at historical memory stores),
Digital Memories (guess who), Tidal Memories (Tina's view on the insubstantial
nature of memory) and Fluid Memories (Agnese's investigation of social
nostalgia). Upon opening each the four boxes, projections trigger onto
surrounding walls, enveloping the visitor in the work.  
  

Although I had an idea of wanting to use social media as part of the project,
it was Katherine's idea of physical records of memory (memory spaces) that
particularly inspired my approach; this prompted me to think of how in the
present day a subset of this is virtual memory spaces. An initial idea was to
join Katherine on one of her photo taking expeditions around Glasgow and
whilst she took photos of physical memory spaces, I would check-in to them
using Foursquare, creating a connection between the historical physical and
the contemporary virtual. Other commitments meant I was unable to go to
Glasgow on the date planned, unfortunately, and this idea wasn't pursued.  
  

Having decided that we would each dedicate something physical to the aspect we
had chosen to consider, I sourced a box, RAM and old maps and was pleased to
entrust the decoration to Liz who is far more proficient at making things
pretty than me. (I absolutely loved the outcome).  
  

Tina and I applied our technical abilities to learning the basics of Max/MSP
and how to use Arduino boards. I am particularly pleased about our decision to
make the installation interactive; I learnt a lot and a door that I didn't
previously know the location of has now been opened to me. The use of Arduino
stuff is something I will definitely investigate further in the not-too-
distant future.  
  

I knew not to be too prescriptive from the outset, as what I was building
would evolve as I discovered things I could and couldn't do. I dropped
Foursquare for the final outcome because the output wasn't that interesting,
and concentrated instead on Flickr and Twitter. I went through several
iterations using different methods to try to get around various limitations of
the Google Maps API. Eventually I settled on the jQuery plugin GMap3; although
I still hit a few stumbling blocks at the last minute that I had to botch
around because of time pressure (using an AppleScript to refresh the page was
not the most elegant of solutions, but the JavaScript _just wouldn't work_. It
didn't make sense, I swear. It did, however, introduce me to AppleScript for
the first time, and the power that lays behind that...).  
  

The aesthetics of the thing could have done with a bit more work, but the
amount of time I had to spend getting the script to technically work meant I
was left with much less time and energy to focus on the appearance than I
would have liked.  
  

Last minute problems with hardware meant that we had to lose the interactive
element of my box (mine was the last one we were due to wire up). This is in
part what encouraged the change of location of my projection, however, and I
think it was far more effective beamed on the floor than it would have been
projected onto a wall. Plus, having it triggered and hidden by the opening and
closing of a box seems unnecessary, and perhaps counter intuitive in
hindsight, as during the exhibition people would watch the activity on the map
for extended periods of time.  
  

I enjoyed working on a project where artistic intention was more important
than code quality, and a final outcome was not strictly defined. This gave me
flexibility to explore and work outside of the scope of computer science
boundaries that I'm used to. Though obviously creative thinking and outside-
of-the-box solutions are highly encouraged in software development fields,
there is certainly an underlying rigidity or 'way of doing things' that is
absent when applying such technology in an artistic context. And if I do end
up back in the 'official' computing world, I'm certain that the kinds of
experiences I gain during ICP will massively enhance my skillset as a creative
developer.  
  

You can check out what I projected [here](http://bit.ly/digimem). This has
only been tested in Chrome - I cannot be held responsible for irregularities
that may occur using other browsers :)  
  

It's worth noting that there are some truly wonderful people who gave up their
time, resources, advice and patience to help us out during the project.
Couldn't have done it without them!  
  

Et, voila:
