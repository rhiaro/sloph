**  
**Read several papers and an [entire book](http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Multimedia_Content_and_the_Semantic_Web.html?id=NN2QuFGlTL8C&redir_esc=y).  Notes to follow.  Literature review inching along.  
  
Got accepted for the [Semantic Web Summer School](http://sssw.org/).  
  
Talked about the SW search engine Watson project during Ontologies with a
View.  This is different from IBM's Jeopardy playing Watson.  
  
Had to write off the bank holiday weekend because a friend visited.  Walked a
_lot_.
