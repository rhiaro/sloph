**Further discussed ILW hack with various parties, and released a [website](http://events.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilw/hack) with information for anyone interested in being involved, and registration for students.

the maths now, and take the class next year, instead of killing myself with
both.  
  
Caught up on all my blogging!
