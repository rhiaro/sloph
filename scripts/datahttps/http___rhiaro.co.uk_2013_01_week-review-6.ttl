**  
**I was subject of Paolo's procedural task labelling pilot experiment.  It was quite complicated.  I don't know if I did a very good job.  
  
I went to TechMeetup and networked like crazy.  
  

  * I talked to Andy Hyde about [ALISS](http://aliss.org/) getting involved with the ILW hack, and Edinburgh OD scene in general.
  * And a few other people about supporting the ILW hack in various ways.
  * I talked to Felix Gilfedder of Popcorn Horror about novel ways of engaging with creative digital media communities (PhD related!)
  * I briefly met Russell, with whom I hope to discuss digital video metadata (PhD related!)
  * One other thing which isn't related to Open Data or my PhD but is very exciting nonetheless.

I went to a Design Informatics talk about the Internet of Things.
