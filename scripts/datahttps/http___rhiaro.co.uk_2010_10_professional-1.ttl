**  
**  
**Speaker:** Ken Blair of BMP Recording  
**Area:** Sound recording/engineer  
  
Although Kenâ€™s area of expertise is not directly relevant to my degree, I have
frequently worked alongside media students both informally and more recently
as part of a start-up company in Sparkhouse. Thus I am able to relate to many
of the things he discussed about sound engineering, as I have had second-hand
experience of creating soundscapes for animations, or musical tracks for short
films, for example. I wrote lots of notes about the details of the things he
does on a regular basis, and the differences between on-location and studio
recording; between recording pop music and recording classical. But it seems
fruitless to transcribe them all here, when his day-to-day experience, while
interesting, is of little consequence to me personally.  
  
However what did catch my interest was that Ken started his own company
straight out of university, similar to what I am involved with in Sparkhouse.
He discussed the â€˜catch twenty-twoâ€™ of needing industry experience to find
work for your company, but people being unwilling to hire because of a
perceived lack of experience. He also affirmed that the decreasing cost of
technology has made it easier for people to create their own recording studio
setups, enabling freelancers to charge the absolute minimum for the work they
do, causing a very competitive price market.  
  
I (and the others I am working with in Sparkhouse) have fortunately been able
to take advantage of the latter issue to solve the former. Several years as
informal student freelancers meant we could afford to charge the minimum, or
work for free, with the focus being on gaining experience and reputation
rather than worrying about earning money. Now we have started our own company,
we can start charging â€˜real worldâ€™ prices to bigger companies, and are able to
do so supported by a significant portfolio of existing work.  
  
Knowing that this method has so far worked for myself and others, I feel Ken
could have offered his hindsight to those in the audience who may not have had
the same experience. That is, he could have advised to take advantage of the
years of having a student loan and lots of free time to build up a portfolio
of work and experience relevant to an individuals particular career aims,
without needing to worry about taxes and bankruptcy. This would help to avoid
the problems that his own company had right at the beginning.  
  
Having said that, level three is probably too late for students to be hearing
that kind of advice; it might be more useful, and inspirational, during level
one.  
  
Ken did offer advice about writing CVs, for those who do have little industry
experience - to focus on oneâ€™s skills, rather than oneâ€™s past jobs - but
commented that employers of new graduates are sympathetic to the lack-of-
experience problem, understanding that their job applicants have just come out
of university. Iâ€™m not convinced that this is a good message to be sending...
Perhaps employees of sound engineers and audio technicians think differently,
but my experience so far in the computing industry (mainly software and web
development areas) has taught me that the new grad job market is so saturated
with graduates with high calibre degrees that having something on your CV that
you _have done_, rather than _can do_ is vital.  
  
Anyone can list the modules theyâ€™ve done, and the programming languages they
have dabbled in over the course of three years. You stand out if you write
about the open source project you contributed to in a specific language, or
the academic poster you presented at a technology conference about your chosen
field. Listing skills has a lot more impact if you can prove that they really
are your skills.
