  as:content """I have my own desk, my own @google.com email address and a shiny shiny MacBook
Pro. I also have a million and one things to remember, three floors to learn
my way around and a ton of name/face/job combinations I've almost certainly
forgotten already. The important thing is, I know where the canteen is. In
fact, I'm still in the office right now (the rest of the team having gone home
almost an hour ago) purely because I'm waiting for the canteen to re-open for
dinner.  
  
Already I have meetings scheduled and an event to attend. I spent a lot of
today learning the ropes of the intranet. There are all these delightful
_extra_ things within the regular Google products you know and love... Things
that aren't available to the public, and that I can't even _talk_ about.
Keeping the excitement inside is painful, but if I breathe a word, there will
probably be a contract on my head. Not really, that would be
[evil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_evil). But I'd be in trouble.  
  
So while I wait for my second free meal of the day, I'm signing up to internal
mailing lists... Things like... the daily menu for the canteen.  
  
Oh, some of you may be interested... I'm entitled to bring two people per
month to the canteen for lunch. That's six people in total. Let me know if
you're interested, although three to four spots are probably already taken by
default.  
  
Now, I hear plates clanking in the distance... Time to go!
