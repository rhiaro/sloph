here](http://digitalmethodsnmi.com/2013/01/23/our-second-even/)).  
  
DMMM was a conference aimed at sociologists and anthropologists and the like,
so, having never studied these disciplines in any way, I was worried I'd have
no idea what was going on.  
  
Fortunately everyone was friendly, and everyone's research was really
interesting, relevant and mostly made sense to me.  You can [read all of the
notes I took here](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/01/notes-digital-methods-as-
mainsteam.html).  
  
Humanities researchers are using and gathering digital data in lots of
interesting and unique ways.  Using social media and other digital methods to
engage with study participants (Jo Belcher, Lorenza Antonucci, Eve Stirling);
sentiment analysis (Mike Thelwell); examining archives; image use in online
interviews (Emma Hutchinson); e-focus groups (Ibrar Bhatt); digital records
(reflections) of a creative arts process (Carole Kirk); crowd-sourcing of
commercial ideas (Temitayo Abinusawa); avatars and virtual interaction spaces
like SecondLife (Evelyn McElhinney); brilliant playful use of hacking to
disrupt discussions about online learning (Jeremy Knox on MOOCs).  
  
_I _talked about digital media on the Semantic Web, with as much of a
sociology swing as I could give it given my limited expertise in that domain.
My slides, beautifully illustrated by [Chloe Dungate (available for hire!
Academic slides starting at Â£2 a drawing!  Loves topics she doesn't understand
so she can be as outrageously creative as
possible!)](http://scarfdemon.tumblr.com/), are [here](http://goo.gl/6dSlD).
You can see my talk notes there, too.  
  
danah boyd, whose work I've followed more or less since my undergraduate,
teleconferenced in to give a really interesting keynote called "Making Sense
of Teen Life: Strategies for Capturing Ethnographic Data in a Networked Era."
She discussed working with young people for the last few years to examine
their use of social networks (mostly MySpace), and all of the challenges and
considerations that came up along the way.  She was surprised a lot.  
  
The open discussion at the end raised a lot of discussion about ethics.  It
was implied at one point that the content of tweets or YouTube comments are
ripe for the picking with no strings attached because they're already in the
public space.  It's definitely not _that_ simple.  
  
There's also a danger of humanities researchers being out of touch with modern
techniques and best practices.  Commercial research is sometimes way ahead,
but there's no communication between each end of the spectrum, so methods get
developed and optimised unnecessarily.  
  
A lot of people had experiences indicating that digital methods in humanities
are often not taken seriously.  Supervisors, ethics committees, funding
bodies, who have only worked with traditional methods can struggle to see the
legitimacy of results gathered by digital means.  On the other hand, certain
levels of ignorance can sometimes work to the researcher's advantage in terms
of being allowed to get stuff done with minimal red tape (because authorities
don't know what questions to ask).  
  
Personally I was interested by this general feeling of novelty about digital
methods.  Having been in computing for almost my whole academic career (not to
mention a child of the Web), a lot of things were being critically and
confusedly discussed that I just take for granted.  Things like the validity
of friendships that exist entirely online, and feelings expressed through
short-lived text alone.  I think arts and humanities researchers who really
want to get to grips with digital methods as legitimate research tools should
consider orchestrating placements alongside technical researchers and
immersing themselves in a world where the main options are all digital by
default.
