Discovering lots of things to write about semantically annotating multimedia
content.  I decided there are three main ways to do this:

  * Technical / objective / statistical data: eg. media type; shutterspeed; framerate; duration; resolution; date created; number of times viewed at a particular source; number of time shared ...
  * Bibliographic: creators and contributors and their roles; methods/location of publication; methods/locations of creation ...
  * Content*: fictional characters; locations; camera movements; scene transitions; colours ...

These categories overlap somewhat really, and when I get round to it I'll type
my Venn diagram up.

  

_Technical_ is easy, and a lot of that is automatically captured by hardware
or software used to produce and edit works.  It's also relatively easy to
extract automatically.  Standards like MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 take care of
formalising it, and [Jane Hunter turned these standards into semantic
ontologies in 2002](http://arxiv.org/html/cs.mm/0210021).

  

_Bibliographic_ can largely - but not entirely - be covered by vocabularies
that have been around forever like Dublin Core, FOAF and various library-
originated things.  Things that might be missing (or I just haven't found them
yet) are associating roles with tasks involved in digital media production,
since pieces are often a collaborative effort.  __ has some idea of
participants and roles, but the purpose of __ is digital rights management
stuff, so it's more concerned with the distribution change, I _think_, than
granular production of content.  I haven't read much about it yet.

  

_Content_ is more interesting, and potentially more useful for ordinary human
beings.  Imagine querying IMDB for "[that film where John Goodman arrests an
animated talking moose on a US highway](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQXEny-
BzKc)" instead of scouring John Goodman's filmography or googling for pictures
of animated meese until you see the right one.  Annotating characters, objects
and events, and stringing them onto a timeline is possible with [OntoMedia](ht
tps://code.google.com/p/contextus/source/browse/trunk/#trunk%2Fontomedia%2Fext
%2Fmedia).  It's very focussed around narratives, which is great, but doesn't
link back to _technical_ so much.  So if you did find the answer to that
query, it wouldn't be able to serve up the timestamp of that particular scene.

  

On top of what I've looked at already, I still have this list to
(re)investigate:

  * BBC Programme Ontology - [here](http://raimond.me.uk/slides/europeana2012/#10), and [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/programmes/2009-09-07.shtml)
  * BBC Mythology Engine - [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2010/03/the-mythology-engine-represent.shtml), and [here](http://www.contextus.net/stories)
  * Yahoo media RSS standards
  * YouTube RSS standards
  * [ComicsML](http://jmac.org/projects/comics_ml/)
  * [Comic Book Markup Language](http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/cbml/)
  * Comics Ontology hack - [here](http://www.r4isstatic.com/231), and [here](http://www.r4isstatic.com/244)
  * [Media Value Chain Ontology](http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-21/media-value-chain-ontology)

A thing I want to do is annotate some amateur content with OntoMedia and with
ABC to see how they compare.  Maybe I'll do
[asdfmovie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYnsfV5N2n8), because it has
associated comics, and multiple people participating in production.  Then I'll
do something live action as well, because I can't base all my research on non-
sequitur lolrandom stick figure cartoons.  
  

Now, back to work..

  

* I want a better name for this, since I'm referring to everything as 'content' anyway.  So some better way of saying 'content of content'.
