  as:name "On extensibility of Microformats" ;
  as:content """Once again, [Amy Guy][1] (member of the [W3C Social Working Group][2] and probably the person with sharpest analytical eye in the group) has done a fantastic breakdown of a SocialWG-related topic. This one is [on the extensibility of Microformats][3]. This is a topic of much back and forth, particularly between "Linked Data" people and "Microformats" people, and maybe Amy's post can reduce a lot of unnecessary cycling. Particularly this point is insightful:

> **Example debate 4**
>
> * _LD:_ Microformats is not extensible (meaning: I can't just add my own terms and have everyone know how to use them).
> * _MF:_ Microformats is extensible (meaning: parsers are vocabulary agnostic).
>
> ... _LD_ is talking about the vocabulary (semantics). _MF_ is replying about the syntax. I think that's why this debate goes round in circles. I hope that clarifies something for both sides.

Way to go, Amy!
