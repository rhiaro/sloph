  as:content """One of the first lessons Turald learned during his time at Castle Qythe was
that spells wear out. They weaken, they lose their power, the more they are
used. They were all taught this, he and his classmates, probably in their very
first week of study. But few eight year olds take this kind of wisdom to
heart. Most are keen to crack on with casting, and nobody thought to question
why some of their oldest tutors never demonstrated even the simplest of
enchantments.  
  
For as long as he could remember, Turald had loved to explore dark places. He
loved to see what was out of sight; to make known the unknown. When he was
fifteen, he discovered a whole section of the castle's cellars that had been
lost for centuries. To the delight of his wizened mentors, the expanse he
found was filled with age-old liquor which had been promptly and
enthusiastically excavated. It was from then that his freedom had been
unofficially granted to roam and explore the castle grounds as extensively as
he saw fit. Recognising his gift for discovery, Turald's studymaster, the
ancient but sprightly Professor Chalmak, quietly overlooked Turald's disregard
for out-of-hours and restricted-area rules that were strictly imposed upon the
other students.  
  
In a broom cupboard, Turald once found a mousehole that lead two hundred
metres north and seventy four years into the past. One of the seniors had been
able to use this to make peace with a long-dead, estranged father who had been
in that classroom, all those years ago.  
  
In the shadowy corner of the library marked 'secret', Turald had found the
headmaster's daughter, missing for over forty years.  
  
In a tunnel that he had found through crawling into a large oak chest, Turald
uncovered a delicate glass vial containing the last breath of the first
philosopher.  
  
When Turald realised that his elders thought him special for his findings, he
began to keep a diary of them. Through his diary entries, he noticed patterns
in his actions. Or rather, repetitions. The shedding of light was the key.
Illumination was all he needed to do to bring something once hidden out into
the open. His ability to conjure just the right incandescence became his
greatest gift. Thus, he practised with vigour.  
  
Caves, caverns, abandoned ruins: Turald devoured their secrets, consumed their
stories. He exhausted the castle grounds, graduated from the Qythe Academy,
and ventured forth into the Olde Lande, searching without hesitation for doors
to throw open. Eyes aglow with his own special kind of vision, he absorbed the
mysteries of a world in shadow.  
  
But spells wear out.  
  
He recalled this first in a forest, under a bristling canopy so thick that the
blackened foliage groping at his legs had long since found ways to sustain
itself that did not rely on the land's pale sun. He could see the trinkets
that had been stowed away by blind magpies in treetrunk nests; the hoards of
stolen food secreted into the undergrowth by milky-eyed squirrels. And then,
he couldn't.  
  
The flicker in his vision was fleeting, but enough to panic Turald, just for a
moment. Enough to make that first ever lesson come rushing back. Still young,
still adventurous, Turald shook his concern aside.  
  
Deeper in the forest, he found a well; a man-made hole into the earth, darker
even than woods entombing it.  
  
Why had man built such a thing so far into the shade? Turald could not resist.  
  
He descended, uncovering a concealed tunnel with his brilliant sight. Time
having vacated entirely, Turald followed the route that stretched before him.
No magic nor mystery, nor hidden treasure presented itself, and the rhythm of
his steps lulled him into a trance. He walked blind for many hours before he
realised he was doing so.  
  
A droplet of water striking the tip of his nose roused him enough for him to
realise he saw nothing. Turald stopped. The sudden lack of motion was jarring,
dizzying. Turald sat. Water seeped into the hem of his robes, and he sat.
Years of advice, words of warning, from teachers, mentors, elders, echoed
through his mind.  
  
Spells wear out.  
  
Spells lose their power. Lose their potency. Lose their meaning.  
  
Save the important spells for when you need them the most. Best to leave this
world with a spell in your heart, than to leave it because your spells have
run out.  
  
Turald's light had run out, so he sat.
