  as:content """It's day nine, and I'm on two thousand, eight hundred and seventy words.  
  
A quick calculation might tell you that that means I'm _quite_ behind
schedule.  <strike>This may be my worst year yet.</strike>  There's still
plenty of time to get back on track though!  Right..?!  
  
I've only spent any time writing on about three or four of those nine days so
far.  But I _have_ been to a conference, organised some
[SocieTea](http://edinburghsocietea.co.uk/) events, read bits and pieces
related to my PhD, cleaned my flat, watched a few episodes of Arrested
Development, learnt some new crochet stitches and started crocheting a hat,
and baked a lot.  
  
I did meet the Edinburgh NanoBeans and had a great time at the write-in in
[Pulp Fiction](http://pulp-books.co.uk/) last Wednesday.  We may have spent
more time collaboratively developing the backstory of Pedro the Guide Bear (a
troubled young grizzly attired in an Elvis costume and boater hat who
constantly struggles against his estranged father, Yogi, the leader of an
organised crime syndicate) than actually writing our novels though.  
  
I have learnt one particularly important thing this year, that's never come up
before.  
  
**Talking ideas through with other people is really useful!  **  
  
Last Sunday, [Beth](http://shethinkstoomuch.wordpress.com/) helped me explain
the absence of a main character's mother and fix a potential looming plot hole
with one fell swoop.  Telling [Kit](http://blog.ninjalith.com/) about the
various civilisations and layout of the land in my world allowed him to pick
holes and question things, raising, and partially solving, some things that
didn't make sense or yet more potential looming plotholes.  And
[Caitlin](http://www.nanowrimo.org/en/participants/caitlin_mc) (a new
NanoBeans writing buddy) pointed out that just because a character had been
anticipating reading a letter for the last thousand words, didn't necessarily
mean the letter _had_ to contain anything interesting... it could be a
disappointment to the character... which helped, as I hadn't figured out what
the letter said, and all of a sudden the character was opening it.  
  
I sure wish blogging about Nano counted towards the word count.
