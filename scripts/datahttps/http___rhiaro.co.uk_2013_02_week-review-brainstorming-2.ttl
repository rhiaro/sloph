**28th January - 3rd February**  
**  
**I read _Annotation of Multimedia using OntoMedia_ by K. Faith Lawrence et al., and we [discussed it during Ontologies with a View](http://ontologieswithaview.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/week-6-annotating-multimedia.html).  OntoMedia might well prove useful in that describing the content of digital media can improve searching, sorting and sharing.  
  
I started reading a couple of other papers by Faith, but haven't finished them
yet, so expect summaries in the near future.  
  
I [brainstormed about decentralised networks](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/02
/phd-gibbering-about-decentralised.html), with thinking of ways of individuals
sharing linked data about themselves and their projects without surrendering
all that data to a server in mind.
