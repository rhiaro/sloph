The 23rd of February was [International Open Data
Day](http://opendataday.org/).  Since this fell at the end of the
[ILWhack](http://blog.rhiaro.co.uk/2013/03/the-smart-data-hack.html) week, it
seemed like a good opportunity to take advantage of the momentum and engage
the stirring Edinburgh Open Data scene.  
  
Many ODD were organised around the world; most of them were hacks.  In
Edinburgh we went for a different approach, thanks largely to input from local
community activists like [Freda](https://twitter.com/fredaobyrne),
[Leah](https://twitter.com/LockhartL), [Andy](https://twitter.com/mrhyde) and
[Ally](https://twitter.com/allytibbitt).  Some might call it 'social hacking'.
Our aim was to gather together people with little knowledge of Open Data,
people with data that may or may not be open, and developers and technical
types.  
  
With Open Data _stuff_ exploding worldwide, and developers going nuts creating
cool apps and services that make use of data being released, it's important,
you see, for {local, small-scale, voluntary, grassroots} groups and
individuals to get involved early on.  Such parties are arguably likely to
benefit the most from empowerment by data, and if they're not part of the
discussion early on we might well see a lot of services developed that meet
needs imagined by a not-quite-connected but well-meaning tecchie.  
  
So on that note, we want to spread the word about Open Data to those who might
normally be left behind.  When these groups know what the possibilities are
(we can show them successful projects, locally (eg. ILWhack) and worldwide),
what is available, and what could and should be available, we empower them to
take action that will benefit them.  More specifically, people can find out
that the English government has released data about such-and-such-of-interest,
and politely demand that the Scottish Parliament or local councils do
similarly.  They can interface early on with developers who are keen to start
making, and make sure _their_ real problems get solved (or at least
prioritised over potential imaginary ones).  They can get involved with things
like ILWhack, and have a better idea of what it's all about.  
  
Between 10am and 2pm, we gathered around 35 people in the Informatics Forum
and, fuelled by tea, coffee and biscuits, began the discussion.  
  
We started with an hour of ten minute talks, about a variety of topics:  
  
  
Sally Kerr told us about Open Data at the City of Edinburgh Council; the
progress they've made so far and where they hope to go in the future; NESTA's
local government Make It Local programme helped Edinburgh Council to move
forward with Open Data.  She gave a nod to the ILWhack projects that made use
of Council data in the week prior.  
  
Alex Stobart of [MyDex](http://mydex.org/) talked about big, open data, and
the challenges this presents to citizens and politicians.  
  
Iain Henderson explained the [Standard Label](http://standardlabel.org/); an
easy to read specification for data holders to present to their users how the
user data will be used.  Like nutritional advice, but for data.. Other ODD
events were centred around hacking with it we spoke!  
  
Bob Kerr talked about OpenStreetMap and GeoRSS.  I love the obsessive
hyperlocal detail in some places, like where the animals live in Edinburgh
Zoo.  On a serious note, OSM has really empowered local governments and NGOs
in developing countries.  
  
Andy Hyde discussed asset mapping for voluntary groups; how ALISS collate
dispersed health and wellbeing information into a central, open repository,
ripe for manual and programmatic access.  
  
From Lizzie Brotherston we heard about the Post-16 Learner Journey Project;
helping the Scottish Government understand the learning landscape.  They're
holding a [hack in April](http://t.co/S6QVpxgRsd).  
  
Next it was _unconference_ time!  
  
We had a short while of whole-room discussion, before identifying three key
areas:  
  

  * Standardising visualisation (headed by Bob Kerr)
  * Small scale voluntary organisations (headed by Leah Lockhart)
  * Sustainability of data projects (headed by Ewan Klein)

Everybody picked a group and we broke apart for the next couple of hours.

  

The final part of the day was a return to the main room, and further room-wide
discussion of the breakout debates.

  

The _s___tandardising visualisations_ _conversation focussed around bringing
people into conversations about data using visuals.  Someone pointed out that
if news readers used Open Data visualisations, the general public would be a
lot more interested in Open Data.  It's interesting to imagine a future where
data visualisations are embedded into the world, into the landscape.  To be
able to interact with data meaningfully, you've got to know what it is - to
recognise it.  A standard - think periodic table - would help people to know
exactly what you're talking about straight away.  This goes beyond graphs and
charts, into a world of layered visualisations that allow layered public
contributions of interpretations.

  

Those interested in _small scale voluntary organisations_ discussed data
holding and data access issues, including strategies for persuading big
organisations to open data (eg. by showing success stories, and proving a
certain return on investment).  It was agreed that interfacing with developers
is important to get things done that organisations really need; but
organisations might not know what they need.  It was discovered that there's a
lot of crossover between groups represented by people who were in this
discussion; common needs but gaps in talent.

  

Finally, with regards to _sustainability of data projects_ it was agreed that
strategies are needed for keeping things going beyond short hack events; how
to sustain that burst of energy for a longer term usefulness?  How to keep
track of everything that's going on, and link communities with events (see
[OpenTechCalendar](http://opentechcalendar.co.uk/)!).  Some kind of
coordination body might be useful, or working groups / task forces.

  

We wrapped up, collected everyone's details for sharing (to ensure
sustainability of the outcomes of the day by making sure everyone can keep in
touch!) and people began to drift away.

  

There was an enormous positive energy throughout the day.  Discussions were
lively and passionate, and we had an excellent mix of people, exactly as hoped
for.

  
  
  
  
NB. It looks like Joined Up Edinburgh will come under the umbrella of the
Scotland branch of the Open Knowledge FoundatioN, so
[http://scot.okfn.org](http://scot.okfn.org/) will be a good place to keep an
eye on now.  And to keep in the loop, join the [Joined Up Edinburgh mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/joinuped).  
  
Other people have blogged about this too.  Check out these by [Leah
Lockhart](http://lockhartl.tumblr.com/post/43974919122/my-thoughts-on-joined-
up-edinburgh-and-the-citys) and [Dave

make.html) (more links welcome).
